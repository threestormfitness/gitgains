### Overview and Execution

Each minute, perform **2 reps** at roughly **80%** of your 1RM. You have 10 minutes total, so that’s 10 sets of 2 reps (20 total reps). After completing the reps, rest until the top of the next minute. Once you can handle 10 sets without form issues, add a small amount of weight the next session.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you can’t complete all sets with good form, decrease the weight by 5% for the next session and rebuild.
- If you find 80% too challenging, start at 75% until you gain confidence.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 10 x 2 at 185 lb. If sets 9 and 10 still feel crisp, move to 190 lb for the next session.
- **Week 2**: 10 x 2 at 190 lb. If the final set is borderline, repeat 190 lb for another session to ensure mastery before going heavier.

### Important Notes

- Prioritize technique over weight increases.
- Keep rests strict; start exactly when each minute begins.

### Volume Metrics

- **Total volume**: 10 × 2 = 20 reps per session.

### Summary

This EMOM style is great for building both strength and technique consistency. The moderate intensity allows repeated high-quality sets, making it approachable for intermediate lifters looking to reinforce form at a decent load.
