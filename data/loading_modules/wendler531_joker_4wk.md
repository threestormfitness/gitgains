## Overview and Execution

### Standard 5/3/1 Breakdown
The 5/3/1 program is a four-week cycle designed to drive long-term strength gains. It uses a “Training Max” (TM) of about 90% of your real or estimated 1RM. Each week focuses on different percentage ranges:

- **Week 1 (5s Week)**  
  - Set 1: 65% x 5  
  - Set 2: 75% x 5  
  - Set 3: 85% x 5+ (AMRAP)

- **Week 2 (3s Week)**  
  - Set 1: 70% x 3  
  - Set 2: 80% x 3  
  - Set 3: 90% x 3+ (AMRAP)

- **Week 3 (5/3/1 Week)**  
  - Set 1: 75% x 5  
  - Set 2: 85% x 3  
  - Set 3: 95% x 1+ (AMRAP)

- **Week 4 (Deload)**  
  - Set 1: 40% x 5  
  - Set 2: 50% x 5  
  - Set 3: 60% x 5  

After the deload week, add 5 lb to upper-body TMs (press, bench) and 10 lb to lower-body TMs (squat, deadlift). This progression repeats every cycle.

### Adding Joker Sets
After finishing each week’s main work (including the AMRAP set), you can perform “Joker Sets” if you feel strong and sufficiently recovered. Simply increase the load by 5–10% for each additional set while keeping the day’s rep count (5s, 3s, or 1s). Continue as long as technique stays solid.

**Key Points**:
- Joker Sets are optional; skip them if the AMRAP set leaves you too fatigued.  
- They do not alter your Training Max for future cycles—simply an autoregulatory way to lift heavier when conditions allow.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies
If you begin missing reps on the main sets or consistently feel too fatigued for AMRAP sets:
- Reduce your Training Max by 5–10% and rebuild momentum.  
- Make sure you aren’t skipping the Week 4 deload.  
- Evaluate nutrition, recovery, and stress levels, as 5/3/1 demands consistent progression over time.

## Example Application

**Intermediate 185 lb Male Lifter** with a 300 lb squat Training Max:

- **Week 1 (5s)**  
  - 65% (195 lb) x 5  
  - 75% (225 lb) x 5  
  - 85% (255 lb) x 5+ (AMRAP)  
  - Optional Joker Sets (if strong):  
    - 90% (270 lb) x 5  
    - 95% (285 lb) x 5

- **Week 2 (3s)**  
  - 70% (210 lb) x 3  
  - 80% (240 lb) x 3  
  - 90% (270 lb) x 3+  
  - Optional Joker Sets:  
    - 95% (285 lb) x 3  
    - 100% (300 lb) x 3

- **Week 3 (5/3/1)**  
  - 75% (225 lb) x 5  
  - 85% (255 lb) x 3  
  - 95% (285 lb) x 1+  
  - Optional Joker Sets:  
    - 100% (300 lb) x 1  
    - 105% (315 lb) x 1

- **Week 4 (Deload)**  
  - 40% (120 lb) x 5  
  - 50% (150 lb) x 5  
  - 60% (180 lb) x 5  

After completing Week 4, add 10 lb to this lifter’s squat TM (now 310 lb) and repeat.

## Important Notes

- **Perform Joker Sets only on days you feel strong.**  
- If technique degrades or you fail a Joker Set, discontinue them.  
- Stick to the standard 5 lb (upper) / 10 lb (lower) increments at the start of each new cycle, regardless of Joker Set performance.  
- Always deload every fourth week to mitigate fatigue and ensure steady long-term progress.

## Volume Metrics

- **Main 5/3/1**: 3 sets per workout (each with final AMRAP).  
- **Joker Sets**: 0–3+ additional sets at increased loads.  
- Overall volume can vary significantly based on how many extra Joker Sets you perform.

## Summary

Wendler’s 5/3/1 with Joker Sets offers a structured four-week cycle for building strength in the squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press. The foundation is the standard 5/3/1 progression, which steadily increases your Training Max by small amounts each cycle. Joker Sets provide an autoregulatory bonus on strong days, allowing you to push heavier while still maintaining Wendler’s straightforward, progression-focused framework. It’s best suited for intermediate to advanced lifters who can accurately gauge their readiness and manage fatigue over multiple cycles.
