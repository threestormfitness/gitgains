## Overview and Execution

**Overview**  
Thibaudeau’s 3-2-1 Wave is a lower-rep, near-max strength method emphasizing neurological adaptations (i.e., teaching your nervous system to recruit more motor units efficiently). Each “wave” consists of three sets performed in descending rep order—3, then 2, then 1—at progressively heavier loads. Once you finish Wave 1 (3–2–1), you begin Wave 2 at a slightly higher load for each corresponding rep range.

**Key Execution Points**

1. **Sets and Reps**
    
    - Perform 3 reps, then 2 reps, then 1 rep for Wave 1.
    - Increase the weight slightly for Wave 2 and repeat the 3–2–1 sequence.
    - If you still feel strong and can add weight, you can attempt Wave 3.
2. **Intensity / Loading**
    
    - Typical ranges: ~85% for the first 3 reps, then ~87.5% for 2 reps, ~90% for 1 rep in Wave 1.
    - Each wave gets progressively heavier (e.g., Wave 2 might be ~87.5% for 3 reps, ~90% for 2 reps, ~92.5% for 1 rep).
3. **Rest Intervals**
    
    - Generally 90–120 seconds between sets.
    - Extend rest to 2–3 minutes if necessary, especially for heavier single-rep sets.
4. **Progression**
    
    - Autoregulate: continue adding waves only if you can maintain form and hit the prescribed reps with heavier weight.
    - Once performance drops or technique fails, conclude the wave session.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail to complete the prescribed reps or cannot increase the load wave-to-wave, it’s a sign to stop adding waves.
- Consider slightly increasing rest periods, reviewing technique, or reducing the load jump if you repeatedly stall.
- If stalling persists, reduce overall intensity for a session or switch to a different training protocol to allow for recovery.

## Example Application

Below is a simple example for an intermediate 185 lbs (~84 kg) male lifter aiming to peak strength in the back squat. Percentages are estimates based on a 1RM of ~365 lbs (165.5 kg). Adjust as needed for your actual 1RM.

**Wave 1**

- Set 1 (3 reps): 310 lbs (~85%)
- Set 2 (2 reps): 320 lbs (~87.5%)
- Set 3 (1 rep): 330 lbs (~90%)

**Wave 2**

- Set 4 (3 reps): 320 lbs (~87.5%)
- Set 5 (2 reps): 330 lbs (~90%)
- Set 6 (1 rep): 340 lbs (~92.5%)

If you still feel strong and want to attempt Wave 3, you might do:

- Set 7 (3 reps): 325 lbs (~89%)
- Set 8 (2 reps): 335 lbs (~91.5%)
- Set 9 (1 rep): 345 lbs (~94%)

**Weekly Structure**

- Perform this 3-2-1 wave approach once or twice per week for the squat (or other main lift) within a training program that includes accessory work on other days.
- On subsequent weeks, you may try starting each wave slightly heavier (e.g., +5 lbs to each set). Continue only as long as technique remains solid and you can hit the prescribed reps.

## Important Notes

- **Avoid Training to Failure**: Keep the bar speed reasonably fast, especially on the single rep, to reinforce neural efficiency.
- **Short, Intense Peaking**: Best used in a brief cycle (2–3 weeks) when you want to sharpen maximal strength.
- **Autoregulation is Key**: If your performance drops, end the waves to prevent excessive strain.

---

## Volume Metrics

- Each wave includes 3 + 2 + 1 = **6 reps total**.
- Typically, 2–3 waves per session = **12–18 total reps** at high intensity.

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s 3-2-1 Wave is a specialized method for rapid strength gains, leveraging neurological factors through near-maximal loading and wave progression. It’s best suited for intermediate to advanced lifters who want to push their 1RM higher over a short peaking phase. By adding small increments with each new wave, you “trick” the nervous system into progressively handling heavier loads. Proper rest, solid technique, and strategic wave increases are essential to maximize benefits and minimize risks.
