## Overview and Execution
This module begins with a load around your 2–3RM. Perform 2 or 3 reps, rest 15 seconds, then reduce the weight by about 5%. Continue performing additional reps at each lower weight with 15-second rests until you’ve reached a total of six reps overall. The goal is to sustain high intensity with minimal rest to maximize strength and muscular endurance in a single, extended drop-set.

---

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies
No specific plateau-breaking strategies are outlined in the original material. If you consistently fail to achieve the total six reps, consider slightly smaller weight drops (e.g., 2–3%) or add additional rest time (e.g., 20–30 seconds) while maintaining safe form.

---

## Example Application
- **Lifter Profile**: Intermediate to advanced, around 185 lbs body weight, back squat 2–3RM ~ 100 kg.
- **Session Flow**:
  1. **Set 1**: 100 kg × 2 reps (your 2RM), rack the weight, rest 15 seconds.
  2. **Drop to 95 kg**: Perform as many reps as possible (likely 1–2), rest 15 seconds.
  3. **Drop to 90 kg**: Perform another rep or two. If you haven’t reached six total reps, rest 15 seconds and drop again (~85 kg), continuing until you hit a total of six.

Repeat this approach for one primary lift per session (e.g., squat, bench). You might use it once per week for each lift, or as an occasional “finisher” when you need a higher-intensity effort.

---

## Important Notes
- Stick to a strict 5% weight drop each time.  
- Maintain good form—no sloppy reps.  
- Use short, 15-second rest periods to keep intensity high.  
- This is a very demanding technique, so limit its use to one or two key movements in a workout.

## Volume Metrics
You’ll typically accumulate one initial “top set” of 2–3 reps, followed by 2–3 drop-sets to reach a total of six reps. In total, it’s 6 near-maximal reps across several rapid-fire micro-sets.

## Summary
Ashley Jones’s Strength Drop Set Style is designed to push limits by extending a near-maximal effort across multiple short, high-intensity sets. It’s best suited for more experienced lifters who can handle loads around 90–95% of their 1RM with sound form and a quick drop-set format. Use it sparingly and expect a tough but highly effective strength challenge.
