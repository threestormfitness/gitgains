### Overview and Execution

Perform a unilateral exercise (e.g., single-arm dumbbell press). Go to near failure on one arm, then switch immediately to the other. Alternate back and forth with minimal rest until both sides reach their near-failure thresholds. Increase load by 2.5–5 lbs once you surpass your target rep total per side (commonly ~20 reps).

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you stop making progress, adopt a deload week (reduce load ~10–20%) and rebuild.
- You can also slightly increase rest between sides (e.g., 10–15 seconds) if you cannot recover quickly enough to maintain form.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male**:

- Single-arm dumbbell press with 55 lbs for ~10 reps per arm.
- Alternate arms until each arm accumulates ~20 total reps.
- If you easily exceed 20 reps per arm, move to 60 lbs next session.
- If you stall, deload to 50 lbs for a week, then resume progression.

### Important Notes

- Great for accessory or isolation work; advanced lifters sometimes use it for compound lifts.
- Monitor side-to-side strength differences.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies** widely based on how many total reps you perform per limb (often 15–30+ reps per side).

### Summary

Alternating Unilateral Rest-Pause is a quick, effective way to push each limb to near failure while the other arm/leg “rests.” Best for moderate-to-high rep hypertrophy training or bringing up weaker sides.
