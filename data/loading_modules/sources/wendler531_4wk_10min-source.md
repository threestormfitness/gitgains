# 5/3/1 Loading Module

## Overview
5/3/1 is a straightforward yet highly effective progression system created by Jim Wendler. Its main purpose is to help lifters build strength steadily over time, with clearly defined percentages and rep goals each week. The hallmark is the final “+ set,” in which you aim for as many reps as possible, driving both progress and personal records without constantly testing your one-rep max.

## Structure
A single 5/3/1 cycle spans four weeks (though you can repeat these cycles indefinitely):

1. **Week 1** (“5s week”)  
   - Set 1: 65% x 5  
   - Set 2: 75% x 5  
   - Set 3: 85% x 5+ (perform as many reps as possible)  

2. **Week 2** (“3s week”)  
   - Set 1: 70% x 3  
   - Set 2: 80% x 3  
   - Set 3: 90% x 3+  

3. **Week 3** (“5/3/1 week”)  
   - Set 1: 75% x 5  
   - Set 2: 85% x 3  
   - Set 3: 95% x 1+  

4. **Week 4** (Deload)  
   - Set 1: 40% x 5  
   - Set 2: 50% x 5  
   - Set 3: 60% x 5  

After completing Week 4, you begin the next cycle, adding 5 pounds to your upper-body training maxes and 10 pounds to your lower-body training maxes (for squat and deadlift).

## Load Selection Guidelines
- **Initial Training Max**: Use **90% of your true 1RM** (or an estimated 1RM) as the basis for the percentages above.  
- **Progression**: After each four-week cycle, increase your training max by 5 pounds for presses and bench, and 10 pounds for squat and deadlift.  
- **“+” Sets**: On these sets (5+, 3+, or 1+), push for as many solid reps as possible to set rep PRs. Don’t sacrifice technique—maintain form and stop when it deteriorates.

## Rest Intervals
- **Main Sets**: Typically **3–5 minutes** between the heavier work sets.  
- **Deload/Light Sets**: You can reduce rest to **1–2 minutes** if desired, though always listen to your energy and recovery needs.

## Execution / Key Considerations
- **Long-Term Mindset**: 5/3/1 is about consistent, incremental progress. Rushing weight jumps or overshooting your true max leads to plateaus.  
- **Focus on Core Lifts**: Usually applied to squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press.  
- **Don’t Skip the Deload**: Week 4’s reduced volume and intensity allows recovery, preventing burnout and injuries.  
- **Who Benefits?**: Ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters seeking steady gains without complicated periodization. Beginners can use it too, as long as they accurately determine their training max and maintain good form.

## Summary
5/3/1 is a proven, repeatable loading structure for systematic strength gains. It centers around moderate percentages of your training max, culminating in a “+ set” each week to drive progression. After every four-week cycle, slightly increase your training max and repeat. This slow, controlled climb keeps you breaking rep records and building consistent strength over the long haul.
