## 2-2-1 Wave Loading

### Overview
The 2-2-1 wave loading scheme is a favorite in some weightlifting circles. It involves doing two sets of 2 reps at increasing loads, followed by a single rep to further “potentiate” the nervous system without excessive fatigue.

### Structure
- **Wave 1**  
  1. Set 1: 2 reps (moderate-to-heavy)  
  2. Set 2: 2 reps (heavier than Set 1)  
  3. Set 3: 1 rep (heaviest of the wave)
- **Wave 2 (and beyond)**  
  1. Set 4: 2 reps (slightly heavier than Set 2)  
  2. Set 5: 2 reps (increment again if possible)  
  3. Set 6: 1 rep (add a bit more weight if technique allows)

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Begin with a weight you can confidently lift for 2 reps without grinding.  
- Each set increases load slightly.  
- Only add a new wave if you can still increment the load. If you stall or fail, stop.

### Rest Intervals
- Typically 90–120 seconds.  
- Weightlifting movements can be more technical; consider slightly longer rests to maintain form and speed.

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Commonly used in Olympic weightlifting training for exercises like the clean & jerk or snatch variations.  
- Prioritizes neural efficiency with low total volume.  
- Since reps are low, it’s best for lifters comfortable handling heavy weight consistently.

### Summary
2-2-1 waves offer a potent way to push maximum strength development without racking up too much fatigue. Perfect for advanced lifters seeking to hone technique under heavier loads and exploit post-tetanic potentiation.
