## Overview and Execution

After completing an appropriate warm-up, the session involves ramping up in singles to discover a daily or weekly one-rep max (1RM). The goal is to perform 5 to 8 progressively heavier singles, resting approximately two minutes between each lift. The intensity should be in the range of 90-100% of your 1RM. Progress is autoregulated, stopping when form deteriorates or you fail to complete a lift. 

Each 1-2 weeks, the primary lift variation should be rotated to avoid plateaus and ensure continued progression.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If stalling occurs or reps are missed, ensure proper recovery and consider altering the lift variation. Additionally, ensure any assistance exercises and rest days are sufficient to support heavy lifting.

## Example Application

**Box Squat Session Example:**

- Warm-up Set:  
  - 135 lbs × 5 reps
- Ramp-up Singles:
  - 225 lbs × 3 reps
  - 315 lbs × 1 rep
  - 365 lbs × 1 rep
  - 385 lbs × 1 rep (Max for the day)

In the next session, you might choose a slight variation of the Box Squat or aim for a heavier single if full recovery has been achieved.

## Important Notes

- This training is demanding and should only be undertaken by individuals with a solid technical foundation, preferably with access to spotters.
- It's particularly suited to advanced lifters.
- The volume is intentionally limited due to the taxing nature of maximal lifts; accessory work can be added if needed but should be consciously monitored.

## Volume Metrics

Each session typically includes 1-2 top singles in addition to warm-up sets.

## Summary

This Max Effort module is a staple in advanced powerlifting programs, offering a methodical approach to developing maximal strength through frequent exposure to near-maximal loads. Its cyclical nature (1-2 weeks per variation) ensures varied stimuli, fostering progressive overload while managing fatigue. Ideal for advanced lifters with a focus on maximal strength capacity and resilience.
