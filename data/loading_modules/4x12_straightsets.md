## Overview and Execution

This module presents a simple hypertrophy approach commonly used in classic bodybuilding. Perform 4 sets of 12 reps with the same weight, resting approximately 60 to 90 seconds between sets. Once all sets are completed successfully with the current weight, increase the weight for the following session. This method is well-suited for developing muscle endurance and achieving hypertrophy without reaching complete muscle failure.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you are unable to complete all 4 sets of 12 with the increased weight, maintain the current weight for subsequent sessions until you can complete every set. Focus on maintaining good form and gradually pushing effort levels closer to the threshold without reaching failure.

## Example Application

Consider the shoulder press as an example exercise for this module. 

- Start Session: 4 sets of 12 reps at 60 lbs.
- Progression: If you complete all 4 sets of 12 reps at this weight, move to 65 lbs in the next session.

Continue this pattern, progressively increasing weight as you successfully complete the prescribed sets and reps.

## Important Notes

- This model prioritizes a higher repetition range to foster muscle endurance and hypertrophy.
- Particularly effective for accessory lifts or during moderate-intensity training days.
- Encourage high effort and quality execution without reaching failure, to ensure continuous progress.

## Volume Metrics

- Total Volume: 4 sets × 12 reps = 48 total reps

## Summary

The 4×12 module is a straightforward hypertrophy-focused approach ideal for those looking to build muscle endurance and size without the risk of training to failure. It is most suitable for intermediate to advanced trainees who are familiar with their baseline 65% 1RM weight and progressively aim to increase muscle mass effectively. The module maintains simplicity with its classic structure, making it a reliable choice for straightforward strength and muscle development.
