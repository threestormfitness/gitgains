# 5/3/1

## Overview
5/3/1 is a simple yet highly effective strength progression system popularized by Jim Wendler. Its main objective is to increase strength steadily over time through moderate percentages of a “Training Max” (TM) and a final “+ set” each week, where you push for extra reps.

## Structure
A typical 5/3/1 cycle spans four weeks:

1. **Week 1 (5s Week)**  
   - Set 1: 65% x 5  
   - Set 2: 75% x 5  
   - Set 3: 85% x 5+ (AMRAP)

2. **Week 2 (3s Week)**  
   - Set 1: 70% x 3  
   - Set 2: 80% x 3  
   - Set 3: 90% x 3+ (AMRAP)

3. **Week 3 (5/3/1 Week)**  
   - Set 1: 75% x 5  
   - Set 2: 85% x 3  
   - Set 3: 95% x 1+ (AMRAP)

4. **Week 4 (Deload)**  
   - Set 1: 40% x 5  
   - Set 2: 50% x 5  
   - Set 3: 60% x 5  

After completing Week 4, start the next cycle by adding 5 lb to your upper-body lifts and 10 lb to your lower-body lifts.

## Load Selection Guidelines
- **Training Max (TM)**: Use ~90% of your true 1RM (or an estimated 1RM) for these percentages.  
- **Progression**: After each four-week cycle, add 5 lb (upper) or 10 lb (lower) to your TM.  
- **“+” Sets**: Aim for as many quality reps as possible without sacrificing form.

## Rest Intervals
- **Main Sets**: 3–5 minutes between heavier sets.  
- **Deload Sets**: 1–2 minutes, or as needed.

## Execution / Key Considerations
- **Consistency**: This program is built on slow, steady progress—avoid big jumps in weight.  
- **Focus on Technique**: Always prioritize form, especially on the AMRAP set.  
- **Deload Importance**: Don’t skip the deload week; it’s critical for recovery.  
- **Best For**: Lifters seeking a straightforward, long-term progression method.

## Summary
5/3/1 offers a balanced approach to building strength with predictable progression. Each four-week cycle culminates in pushing a “+ set” for extra reps. Then you slightly increase your TM and repeat, ensuring long-term gains without burnout.

# 5/3/1 with Joker Sets

## Overview
Joker Sets add an autoregulatory element to the standard 5/3/1 approach. After the day’s final AMRAP set, you can perform additional sets by slightly increasing the weight for the same rep scheme—*only if* you feel strong and recovered enough to handle it.

## Structure
1. **Complete the Main 5/3/1 Work**  
   - Perform the standard 5/3/1 sets and the AMRAP set.
2. **Assess Readiness**  
   - If you still feel strong, proceed to Joker Sets.
3. **Joker Sets**  
   - Increase the load by 5–10% each set.  
   - Keep the day’s rep scheme (e.g., sets of 5 on “5s” week).  
   - Continue adding weight in small increments until form or strength begins to falter.

Example (5s Week, TM = 300 lb):
- 65% x 5 (195 lb)  
- 75% x 5 (225 lb)  
- 85% x 5+ (255 lb, AMRAP)  
- **Joker Sets** (Optional)  
  - 90% x 5 (270 lb)  
  - 95% x 5 (285 lb)  
  - 100% x 5 (300 lb)

## Load Selection Guidelines
- **Same TM**: Joker Sets do not alter your established Training Max.  
- **Incremental Steps**: Add 5–10% per Joker Set.  
- **Stop Early**: If technique suffers, end the Joker Sets.

## Rest Intervals
- **Joker Sets**: Rest as needed (3–5 minutes) since these are heavier attempts.  
- **Main Work**: As per standard 5/3/1 guidelines.

## Execution / Key Considerations
- **Optional Addition**: Joker Sets are not mandatory; use them when you feel especially strong.  
- **Fatigue Management**: The AMRAP set can be exhausting. If you’re spent, skip Joker Sets.  
- **No Progression Adjustment**: Performance on Joker Sets does not change your next cycle’s TM increases.  
- **Avoid Overuse**: Frequent heavy attempts can lead to overtraining.

## Summary
5/3/1 with Joker Sets lets you capitalize on good training days. Perform your usual 5/3/1 work, then add heavier sets in small increments if your energy and form allow. This approach adds flexibility without disrupting 5/3/1’s core progression structure.
