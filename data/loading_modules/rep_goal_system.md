## Overview and Execution

The Rep Goal System is designed to be flexible and auto-regulative, allowing you to adjust the number of sets based on daily performance. The key is to select a target rep count (e.g., 25 reps) for a particular exercise. Use a consistent weight and perform as many sets as necessary until you meet the total rep target. As you become stronger and can achieve the target with fewer sets, it's time to increase the weight.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you experience a plateau in achieving the targeted reps with your current weight, consider minor adjustments such as increasing rest time between sets, altering your overall program to address potential weaknesses, or employing different rep schemes for variety and stimulation.

## Example Application

**Exercise**: Dumbbell Curl  
- **Target Reps**: 30 total reps
- **First Session**: 15 reps, 10 reps, 5 reps (using a selected weight: 50 lbs)
- **Progression**: Once able, increase to 55 lbs, aim for sets of approximately 12, 9, etc.

The aim is to reach 30 reps in fewer sets over several training sessions, indicating readiness to increase the load.

## Important Notes

- The system is beneficial for self-regulation on both good and bad days.
- Keeping track of the number of sets required to reach the total reps is crucial for tracking progression.

## Volume Metrics

Typical volume for a session is around 25-30 reps per exercise, though this can vary based on the specific rep target and number of sets completed.

## Summary

The Rep Goal System is tailored for intermediate-level trainees seeking a flexible method that allows for adaptive progression based on performance. This system effectively manages variability in daily strength and energy levels, providing a practical framework for consistent progress in strength training. Suitable for all major lifts, the Rep Goal System aligns with the principle of increasing load once the target reps can be achieved with fewer sets, making it a robust choice for sustained training advancement.
