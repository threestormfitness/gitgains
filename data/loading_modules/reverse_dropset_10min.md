### Overview and Execution

Reverse Drop Sets start with a high-rep, lower-weight set to induce early fatigue. Then you increase weight and drop the rep count. For example, do 15–20 reps, add 10–20% weight for 10–12 reps, and add another 10–20% for 6–8 reps to failure. Progress by raising your initial (lightest) weight once you comfortably exceed the top of each rep range.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- Not explicitly stated, but if you stall at the heavier sets, consider smaller weight jumps or incorporate partial reps at the end.
- You could also slightly reduce your first set’s rep target to conserve energy for the heavier sets.

### Example Application

**Week 1** (Leg Extensions):

- 60 lb × 15–20 reps
- 70 lb × 10–12 reps
- 80 lb × 6–8 reps (to failure)

If you manage 20 reps on the first set and 8 reps on the last, move all weights up by 5 lb next session.

### Important Notes

- The final heavy set goes to failure, so be mindful of form to avoid injury.
- You can apply this method to isolation movements (like leg curls or triceps pushdowns) or even certain machine-based compound exercises.

### Volume Metrics

You typically do 3 working sets, hitting high reps on the first set and ramping up weight as reps decrease.

### Summary

Reverse Drop Sets hit multiple rep ranges in one session, potentially targeting different muscle fiber types. This method suits bodybuilders and intermediate lifters looking for a varied stimulus within a short timeframe.
