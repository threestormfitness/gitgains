## Overview and Execution

The Dynamic Effort Method for the upper body involves performing 9 sets of 3 reps of fast, explosive bench presses using approximately 50-60% of your one-rep max (1RM) plus accommodating resistance like bands or chains. The key is to maintain maximal bar speed on each repetition. Allow 30-60 seconds of rest between sets to ensure recovery without compromising the velocity of the movement.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you find that your bar speed slows down, it's recommended to slightly increase the rest interval or reduce the load to maintain speed. This approach helps ensure that the training stress remains focused on developing explosive power.

## Example Application

- **Week 1**: Bench Press, 9×3 @ 50% 1RM + 25% band tension, 45s rest each set.
- **Week 2**: Increase intensity to 55% 1RM + 25% band tension.
- **Week 3**: Increase intensity to 60% 1RM + 25% band tension.

This progression allows for adaptation and targets the dynamic effort goal of increased bar speed through the wave cycle.

## Important Notes

- Keep the weight submaximal to focus on velocity.
- If bar speed decreases, adjust rest or load.
- Avoid training to failure; the intent is to develop speed rather than muscle failure.

## Volume Metrics

The volume for the session is comprised of 9 sets of 3 reps, totaling 27 speed repetitions.

## Summary

This Dynamic Effort module is designed for intermediate to advanced athletes aiming to enhance explosive power in the bench or pressing movements. By using submaximal loads and focusing on bar speed, this method aids in developing rapid force output. This is essential for athletes looking to improve their performance in explosive tasks, blending well with strength and hypertrophy work in broader training cycles.
