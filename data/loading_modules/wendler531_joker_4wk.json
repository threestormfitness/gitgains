    "example_application": "5s week main: 65%×5, 75%×5, 85%×5+. If performance is good, do Joker Sets: 90%×5, 95%×5, etc. Repeat for 3s and 1s weeks, then deload in Week 4.",
    "important_notes": "Perform Joker Sets only on days you feel strong. They do not affect your Training Max increments. Stop as soon as form or speed declines.",
    "volume_metrics": "Minimum 3 sets for main work, plus 0–3+ Joker Sets at heavier loads, so total sets vary."
