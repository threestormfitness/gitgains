# Boring But Big - Ascending

## Overview

The **Boring But Big (BBB) Ascending** variation is an assistance work module designed to build size and work capacity by following a structured progression of **5 sets of 10 reps**, increasing the weight across the sets. Unlike the standard BBB approach, which typically uses a single weight, this method **gradually increases intensity** while maintaining volume. It’s a great way to increase workload without jumping straight into heavier percentages.

## Structure

- **5 sets of 10 reps**, increasing the weight each set.
- The percentage of your **Training Max (TM)** progresses upwards each set.
- The general recommended loading pattern:
  - **Set 1** – 30% of TM
  - **Set 2** – 40% of TM
  - **Set 3** – 50% of TM
  - **Set 4** – 60% of TM
  - **Set 5** – 70% of TM
- This progression allows for **gradual overload** while reducing the risk of excessive fatigue early in the sets.

## Load Selection Guidelines

- **Start conservatively**, especially if new to high-rep volume work.
- **Adjust the percentages** based on individual recovery ability. If 70% is too challenging for 10 reps, reduce it slightly.
- **Progression options**:
  - Increase each set by **5 lbs per week**.
  - Increase the **top set (Set 5)** by **2.5–5% per cycle** while keeping earlier sets lighter.
  - Cycle through **three phases**:
    - **Cycle One**: 30%-50% TM for all 5x10 sets.
    - **Cycle Two**: 40%-60% TM for all 5x10 sets.
    - **Cycle Three**: 50%-70% TM for all 5x10 sets.
  - After three cycles, keep the **final cycle’s top weight as a new baseline**.

## Rest Intervals

- **60–90 seconds** between sets for **hypertrophy focus**.
- **2 minutes** if strength retention is a concern or if higher percentages are used.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- **Best for lifters** looking to balance **hypertrophy** and **fatigue management** while still maintaining intensity.
- **Lighter first sets** help with **movement patterning** and allow for **better execution** of heavier reps.
- **Squats and deadlifts** in this format can be **very taxing**—consider adjusting percentages if fatigue becomes an issue.
- **Supersetting** the pressing movements (bench/press) with **lat work** can improve efficiency.
- **Grip work**: If using **deadlifts**, straps are fine, but if grip strength is a priority, maintain a **double overhand grip** at lighter percentages.

## Summary

The **Boring But Big (Ascending Only)** approach provides **progressive overload** in a **high-volume framework**, making it ideal for **size and work capacity development**. By **gradually increasing intensity**, lifters can **adapt to heavier loads** without over-fatiguing early sets. This method works well as a **bridge between hypertrophy and strength work**, making it a valuable tool in long-term programming.
