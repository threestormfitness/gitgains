## Overview and Execution

The 5×8 Linear Progression module involves performing 5 sets of 8 repetitions using the same weight throughout. The intensity should be approximately 70-75% of your one-repetition maximum (1RM). The goal is to complete all 5 sets with good form; once achieved, increase the weight by approximately 5 pounds in the next session. Each session should be around 10 minutes, including rest periods of about 90 seconds between sets. This straightforward approach promotes progressive overload, making it beneficial for hypertrophy.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you find yourself stalling and unable to progress after multiple sessions, consider implementing a deload week. A deload week would involve reducing the volume or intensity to allow for recovery before attempting the 5×8 workload again.

## Example Application

A realistic example for implementing the 5×8 Linear Progression is using a compound lift, like the Barbell Row. Start with a weight you can manage, such as 135 lbs:

- **Session 1**: Barbell Row: 5×8 @ 135 lb
- **Progression**: If the above session is completed successfully with good form, increase to 140 lb in the next session.

Progress through subsequent sessions using the same logic, incrementing by 5 lbs after successfully completing all 5 sets of 8 reps.

## Important Notes

- This program avoids training to failure; always stop one rep short.
- Focus on maintaining good form throughout all sets.
- Provides a balanced volume for muscle growth without excessive strain.

## Volume Metrics

- **Total Sets/Reps**: 5 sets × 8 reps = 40 total reps per session

## Summary

The 5×8 Linear Progression is a traditional bodybuilding/powerbuilding approach that suits anyone looking to build muscle through straightforward progressive overload. It works well for intermediate lifters familiar with compound or main accessory movements. By maintaining consistent volume and intensity, lifters can expect steady progression, making it an ideal choice for those prioritizing hypertrophy with manageable workloads.
