Certainly! To assist you in training Windsurf with up-to-date API calls for models like o1 and GPT-4o, here's a reference guide that outlines the necessary steps and code examples.

**1. Setting Up the Environment**

Before making API calls, ensure you have the OpenAI Python library installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install openai
```

**2. Importing the OpenAI Library**

In your Python script, import the OpenAI library:

```python
import openai
```

**3. Authenticating with the API**

Set your OpenAI API key for authentication:

```python
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key-here'
```

Replace `'your-api-key-here'` with your actual OpenAI API key.

**4. Making API Calls**

Depending on the model you intend to use, the API calls will differ slightly.

**a. Using the o1 Model**

The o1 model is designed for complex reasoning tasks. Here's how to make a request:

```python
response = openai.Completion.create(
    model="o1",
    prompt="Your prompt here",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=2000
)

generated_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(generated_text)
```

**b. Using the GPT-4o Model**

GPT-4o is a multimodal model capable of processing and generating text, images, and audio. For text-based interactions:

```python
response = openai.Completion.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    prompt="Your prompt here",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=2000
)

generated_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(generated_text)
```

**5. Handling Multimodal Inputs with GPT-4o**

GPT-4o can process various input types. For example, to process an image:

```python
with open("image.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    response = openai.Image.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        file=image_file,
        prompt="Describe the content of this image."
    )

description = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(description)
```

**6. Additional Considerations**

- **Temperature**: Controls the randomness of the output. A lower value (e.g., 0.2) makes the output more deterministic, while a higher value (e.g., 0.8) introduces more randomness.

- **Max Tokens**: Limits the number of tokens in the generated response. Ensure this is set appropriately based on your application's requirements.

- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage API exceptions gracefully.
