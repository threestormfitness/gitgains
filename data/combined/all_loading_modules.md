## Overview and Execution

**10×3** uses heavier weights for short bursts of 3 reps, repeated for 10 total sets. Rest intervals can range from 60–90 seconds (for more metabolic stress) to 2–3 minutes (for strength emphasis). Increase the load by 2.5–5 lb when you consistently complete all sets.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail to get 3 reps in multiple sets for two consecutive sessions, deload by 5–10% and rebuild in small increments.

## Example Application

For a 185 lb intermediate:

- **Session 1**: 10×3 @ 150 lb
- **Session 2**: 10×3 @ 155 lb
- If failing sets at 160 lb, retry next session.
- If failing again, drop to ~145 lb.

## Important Notes

- This module balances **intensity** (heavy weight) with **volume** (10 sets).
- Keep an eye on cumulative fatigue across many sets.

## Volume Metrics

10 sets × 3 reps = 30 total reps.

## Summary

The **10×3** structure offers a high-intensity, high-volume approach. It’s favored by lifters looking for both strength gains and noticeable muscle hypertrophy.

### Overview and Execution

You’ll pair a heavy single (around 90–92% of 1RM) with a reduced-weight set of 6 reps (around 80–85% of 1RM). Rest 2–3 minutes between the single and the 6-rep set, then another 2–3 minutes before repeating. Complete 3 total cycles. Once you can finish all three cycles without form breakdown or missed reps, add 2.5–5 lb next session.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you miss reps at the 6-rep mark, slightly reduce your 6-rep load or add short “cluster” breaks (10–15 seconds) within the set.
- If the single feels unsteady or too heavy, lower it to ~85% for a while, then build back up.

### Example Application

For an intermediate lifter who benches ~250 lb for 1RM:

- **Week 1**:
    - 1 rep at 225 lb (90% of 1RM), rest 3 minutes
    - 6 reps at 200 lb (80%), rest 3 minutes, repeat for 3 cycles
- **Week 2**:
    - If it was successful (all reps completed), add 5 lb to each weight (e.g., single at 230, 6 reps at 205).

### Important Notes

This approach is somewhat advanced—ensure you’re comfortable handling near-max loads. Keep strict rest intervals to maintain performance consistency.

### Volume Metrics

Each session typically involves 6 working sets: 3 heavy singles + 3 sets of 6.

### Summary

The 1-6 Drop Set blends a near-maximal single to recruit high-threshold motor units, followed by a moderate-heavy set of 6 to capitalize on the heightened neural drive. Ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters looking to bridge strength and hypertrophy goals.

## Overview and Execution

**3×10** is a traditional higher-rep setup. Select a weight you can manage for 10 reps across 3 sets, resting ~1–2 minutes between sets. Progress by 2.5–5 lb when you complete all sets with good form.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you fail to hit all 10 reps in any set for **two sessions in a row**, drop the weight by 5–10% and build back up in small increments.

## Example Application

An intermediate 185 lb male lifter might do:

- **Session 1**: 3×10 @ 80 lb
- **Session 2**: 3×10 @ 85 lb
- **Session 3**: 3×10 @ 90 lb
- If failing 90 lb twice, deload to 80–85 lb and move forward again.

## Important Notes

- Emphasize controlled reps for hypertrophy.
- Good for accessory lifts or when focusing on muscular endurance.

## Volume Metrics

3 sets × 10 reps = 30 total reps.

## Summary

The **3×10** approach is a time-tested bodybuilding staple, balancing volume and moderate intensity for muscle growth and stamina.

## Overview and Execution

**3×12** targets hypertrophy and muscular endurance at slightly higher rep ranges. Perform three sets of 12 reps, resting ~1–2 minutes between sets. Increase the load by 2.5–5 lb when you complete 3×12 successfully.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you fail to reach 12 reps for two sessions in a row, deload by ~10% and resume progression from there.

## Example Application

- **Week 1**: 3×12 @ 70 lb
- **Week 2**: 3×12 @ 75 lb
- **Week 3**: If you fail at 80 lb (12, 12, 9), retry 80 lb next session.
- If stuck again, drop to ~70 lb and work back up.

## Important Notes

- Prioritize form and tempo, as higher reps can lead to fatigue-based technique breakdown.
- Particularly useful for accessory or isolation work.

## Volume Metrics

3 sets × 12 reps = 36 total reps.

## Summary

The **3×12** scheme is well-suited for lifters aiming to increase muscle size and endurance, fitting neatly into hypertrophy-focused blocks.

## Overview and Execution

In the **3×5** method, you do three sets of five reps each at a constant weight. Increase by 5 lb on the main lifts each successful session (2.5 lb for smaller lifts like overhead press). Rest around 3 minutes between sets.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

When you miss 5 reps or can’t complete all three sets for **two or three sessions** in a row, reduce the load by ~10% and build back up.

## Example Application

- **Session 1**: 3×5 @ 135 lb
- **Session 2**: 3×5 @ 140 lb
- **Session 3**: 3×5 @ 145 lb
- If repeated failures at 145 lb, deload to ~130 lb and resume progression.

## Important Notes

- This layout is a staple of _Starting Strength_ for novice lifters.
- Focus on perfecting technique and consistent progression.

## Volume Metrics

3 sets × 5 reps = 15 total reps per session.

## Summary

**3×5** is a foundational strength-building module, best suited to beginners or intermediates needing simple linear progression with minimal complexity.

## Overview and Execution

This module uses three straight sets of eight reps each. You begin by selecting a weight you can manage for all 8 reps across all sets (with 1–2 reps left in the tank). After completing all 3 sets successfully, add 5 lb (or smaller increments if needed) in the next session. Rest ~90 seconds to 2 minutes between sets.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you fail to reach 8 reps on at least one set for **two consecutive sessions**, reduce the load by about 10% in the following session. Then progress again using 5 lb increments as before.

## Example Application

An intermediate 185 lb male lifter might run it like this:

- **Session 1**: 3×8 @ 100 lb
- **Session 2**: 3×8 @ 105 lb
- **Session 3**: 3×8 @ 110 lb (if successful, keep adding 5 lb)
- **Session 4**: If you fail to get 8 reps (e.g., 8, 8, 6), try 110 lb again next session.
- **Session 5**: If you fail again, deload to ~100 lb and work back up.

## Important Notes

- Maintain strict form; don’t chase heavier loads if technique breaks down.
- Smaller increments (2.5 lb) are advisable for upper-body lifts if progress stalls frequently.

## Volume Metrics

Total volume is 3 sets × 8 reps = 24 reps per exercise per session.

## Summary

The **3×8** module provides a balance of hypertrophy and manageable load increments. It’s ideal for novice or intermediate trainees seeking moderate volume and straightforward progression.

### Overview and Execution

Use ~75% of your 1RM. Each set is broken into mini-clusters: do 2 reps, rest 10 seconds, 2 reps, rest 20 seconds, then 2 reps (total 6 reps per set). Rest 2–3 minutes between sets. Complete 4 sets. Increase weight 2.5–5 lbs once you can comfortably finish all 6 reps in each set.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If 10s/20s rests are insufficient, add a few seconds of rest or reduce the load temporarily.
- Progress in small increments to avoid burnout.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a 225 lb bent-over row 1RM:

- Start at ~170 lbs (75%).
- Perform 2 reps, rest 10s, 2 reps, rest 20s, 2 reps (1 set). Rest 2 min. Repeat 4 times.
- If all sets are completed smoothly, try 175 lbs next session.

### Important Notes

- This approach balances moderate intensity with short intra-set rests to maintain form.
- Great for hypertrophy or strength-endurance without excessive loads.

### Volume Metrics

- **4 sets × 6 reps = 24 total reps** at moderate intensity.

### Summary

A 4×6 cluster approach with variable rest helps maintain quality reps throughout each set. Ideal for lifters wanting a middle ground between pure strength work and classic hypertrophy volumes.

## Overview and Execution

**4×6** targets both strength and hypertrophy. You’ll perform four straight sets of six reps, resting 2–3 minutes between each. If you achieve all 6 reps on all 4 sets, increase the load by 2.5–5 lb next session.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

When you fail to complete 6 reps in at least two sets for **two consecutive sessions**, deload by 5–10% and ramp back up.

## Example Application

An intermediate 185 lb male might run:

- **Week 1**: 4×6 @ 150 lb
- **Week 2**: 4×6 @ 155 lb (if all sets hit 6 reps, continue adding 5 lb)
- **Week 3**: 4×6 @ 160 lb. If at any point he fails to reach 6 reps twice in a row, drop weight to around 145 lb and build back up.

## Important Notes

- Aim for consistent technique and keep rest intervals in the 2–3 minute range.
- Use smaller increments for overhead or isolation movements if needed.

## Volume Metrics

4 sets × 6 reps = 24 total reps.

## Summary

The **4×6** module is ideal for individuals seeking a balance of strength and size. Its moderate rep range encourages solid progression without excessively long workouts.

## Overview and Execution

With **4×8**, you achieve a solid blend of hypertrophy and moderate strength. Pick a weight that allows you to complete 8 reps across 4 sets, resting ~1–2 minutes in between. Increase load by 2.5–5 lb when you hit all sets of 8.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you fail to get 8 reps across all sets for **two sessions**, drop the load by ~5–10% and resume progression from there.

## Example Application

- **Week 1**: 4×8 @ 100 lb
- **Week 2**: 4×8 @ 105 lb
- **Week 3**: If you fail at 110 lb, retry next week.
- If still failing, reduce to 100 lb and climb again.

## Important Notes

- Ideal for intermediate lifters who want more volume than 3×8 but still prefer moderate reps.
- Watch for form breakdown, especially in later sets.

## Volume Metrics

4 sets × 8 reps = 32 total reps.

## Summary

**4×8** is a versatile module that enhances hypertrophy and moderate strength gains, fitting comfortably into many intermediate-level programs.

### Overview and Execution

With ~85% 1RM on the bar, do 5 reps, rest 20s, then 3 reps, rest 20s, then 2 reps. That completes one cluster set. Rest 2–3 minutes, then repeat for a total of 3 such cluster sets. Increase weight by 2.5–5 lbs once you can cleanly hit all reps each cluster.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail any reps in the sequence, increase intra-set rest to 30s or reduce load by ~5% until you adapt.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a 365 lb deadlift 1RM:

- Start at ~310 lbs (85%). Perform 5 reps, rest 20s, do 3 reps, rest 20s, do 2 reps. Rest 3 min. Repeat twice more.
- If you complete all reps over 3 clusters, move to 315 lbs next time.

### Important Notes

- Short rests allow decent recovery while keeping intensity high.
- Good for moderate-volume, high-intensity strength training.

### Volume Metrics

- **3 sets** × (5+3+2) = **30 total reps** if all are completed.

### Summary

5–3–2 cluster sets deliver a descending rep scheme in short bursts. Great for intermediate lifters seeking high-intensity work without the burnout of longer continuous sets.

## Overview and Execution

In **5×10**, you typically work at a lighter percentage of your max (often 50–60% 1RM) for high-volume sets. Perform five sets of 10 reps each, resting about 1–2 minutes between sets. Increase by about 5 lb once you can complete all 5 sets without failing.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you fail to reach 10 reps for two straight sessions, reduce your training weight by 5–10% and climb back up as before.

## Example Application

- **Week 1**: 5×10 @ 100 lb
- **Week 2**: 5×10 @ 105 lb
- **Week 3**: 5×10 @ 110 lb if successful.
- If stalling at 110 lb for two weeks, drop to 100 lb or 95 lb and progress again.

## Important Notes

- This module is common as an accessory to heavy main lifts (like in Wendler’s “Boring But Big”).
- Expect significant muscle fatigue; do not compromise form toward the end of each set.

## Volume Metrics

5 sets × 10 reps = 50 total reps.

## Summary

**5×10** provides substantial hypertrophy stimulus and improved work capacity. It’s well-suited for intermediate lifters who can handle higher volume without risking form deterioration.

## Overview and Execution

In the **5×3** module, you handle heavier loads for fewer reps. Perform five sets of three reps each, aiming to add 2.5–5 lb whenever you complete all reps successfully. Longer rest periods (3–5 minutes) may be required due to the heavier intensity.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you fail for two consecutive sessions at the same weight, drop by ~10% in the next workout and build back up in small increments.

## Example Application

- **Week 1**: 5×3 @ 185 lb
- **Week 2**: 5×3 @ 190 lb
- **Week 3**: 5×3 @ 195 lb if successful previously. If failing 195 lb twice in a row, deload to ~175 lb.

## Important Notes

- Good progression path after standard 5×5 stalls.
- Pay close attention to form when using heavier loads.

## Volume Metrics

5 sets × 3 reps = 15 total reps.

## Summary

**5×3** is aimed at intermediate lifters who require a higher-intensity, lower-volume approach for continued strength gains.

### Overview and Execution

Select a load for which you could manage ~6–7 reps in a straight set (about 80–85% 1RM). For each of the 5 sets:

1. Perform 2 reps, rest 15 seconds,
2. Perform 2 reps, rest 15 seconds,
3. Perform 1 rep (5 total).  
    Rest 2–3 minutes before starting the next set. Once you can hit all 5 sets consistently, increase the load by 2.5–5 lbs.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- Slightly increase rest (to 20s) within the cluster if you’re missing reps.
- If stalling continues, drop the load ~5–10% and work back up.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a ~265 lb bench press 1RM:

- You might start at ~220 lbs (about 83%).
- Perform: (2 reps, rest 15s, 2 reps, rest 15s, 1 rep) = 1 cluster set. Do 5 of these total.
- If you complete all sets, try 225 lbs next session.

### Important Notes

- Clustering the set into 2-2-1 helps maintain bar speed and form, avoiding the burnout of 5 continuous reps.

### Volume Metrics

- **5 sets × 5 reps = 25 total reps** at a relatively high intensity.

### Summary

This 5×5 cluster variation provides a more manageable approach to heavier 5-rep sets. It’s a solid method for building strength without the sudden fatigue spikes typical of straight-set 5×5 programs.

## Overview and Execution

**5×5** is a cornerstone of linear progression strength programs. Perform five sets of five reps across all sets with the same weight. If you complete all 25 reps, increase the load by 5 lb (or 2.5 lb for smaller lifts) at the next session. Rest 3–5 minutes between sets for adequate recovery.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail to complete 5 reps on all sets for **two consecutive sessions**, reduce the load by about 10% and build back up, continuing to progress in 5 lb increments.

## Example Application

A 185 lb male lifter might do:

- **Session 1**: 5×5 @ 100 lb
- **Session 2**: 5×5 @ 105 lb
- **Session 3**: 5×5 @ 110 lb
- If stalling at 110 lb twice, deload to ~100 lb and progress again.

## Important Notes

- This module works best for compound lifts (squats, bench, rows, etc.).
- Keep careful track of progression; small plates can help sustain progress.

## Volume Metrics

5 sets × 5 reps = 25 total reps per exercise.

## Summary

The **5×5** approach is well-established for building raw strength and muscle. It’s especially suitable for novice and intermediate lifters needing a structured, progressive routine.

### Overview and Execution

Start at ~80% 1RM for 6 reps, rest ~15 seconds, increase weight slightly (2–3%) for 5 reps, rest ~15 seconds, and keep increasing as reps decrease—down to 1 rep at ~90% 1RM. After one full wave (6-5-4-3-2-1), you can rest 2–3 minutes and optionally do a second wave with slightly heavier loads or the same load if near max effort.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail a rep in the middle of a wave, reduce the load for subsequent mini-sets or skip the last set of the wave.
- Gradually micro-load if jumps are too large.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a 315 lb squat 1RM:

- **Wave 1**: 6 reps @ 250 lbs (~80%), rest 15s, 5 reps @ 255 lbs, rest 15s, 4 reps @ 260 lbs, rest 15s, 3 reps @ 265 lbs, rest 15s, 2 reps @ 270 lbs, rest 15s, 1 rep @ 275 lbs.
- Rest 2–3 minutes, then attempt a second wave with slightly heavier loads if you had more in the tank.

### Important Notes

- This technique is advanced; wave loading can be taxing on the CNS.
- Short rests are integral to keep tension high.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**, generally 21 total reps per wave (6+5+4+3+2+1). One or two waves is typical.

### Summary

6–1 wave loading with rest-pause brings a broad range of rep targets into one extended sequence, tapping into both strength and hypertrophy. It’s well-suited for experienced lifters looking for variety and a challenging, time-efficient protocol.

### Overview and Execution

Use ~80% 1RM to maintain explosiveness. Perform 4 fast, powerful reps. If needed, rest ~15 seconds inside the set to reset your explosiveness, then continue. Complete 6 total sets, resting 2–3 minutes between sets. Increase weight slightly (2.5–5 lbs) once you maintain high speed across all reps.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If bar speed slows too much, reduce load or increase rest between sets. Power emphasis is key, so you never want grinding reps.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a 225 lb power clean 1RM:

- Perform sets at ~180 lbs (80%).
- 4 fast reps, rest 15s if needed (or do them in one go if you can maintain speed), then rest 2 min.
- After 6 sets, if speed was consistent, try 185 lbs next session.

### Important Notes

- This is specifically for power development.
- Technique and explosive intent trump total reps.

### Volume Metrics

- **6 sets × 4 reps = 24 total reps** at moderate-high intensity.

### Summary

6×4 cluster sets provide enough rest to maintain explosive power in each set. Ideal for intermediate or advanced athletes focusing on speed-strength qualities rather than pure hypertrophy.

| **volume_metrics**            | `1 initial set plus 2-3 drop sets to reach 6 total reps`    |

---

## Overview and Execution
This module begins with a load around your 2–3RM. Perform 2 or 3 reps, rest 15 seconds, then reduce the weight by about 5%. Continue performing additional reps at each lower weight with 15-second rests until you’ve reached a total of six reps overall. The goal is to sustain high intensity with minimal rest to maximize strength and muscular endurance in a single, extended drop-set.

---

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies
No specific plateau-breaking strategies are outlined in the original material. If you consistently fail to achieve the total six reps, consider slightly smaller weight drops (e.g., 2–3%) or add additional rest time (e.g., 20–30 seconds) while maintaining safe form.

---

## Example Application
- **Lifter Profile**: Intermediate to advanced, around 185 lbs body weight, back squat 2–3RM ~ 100 kg.
- **Session Flow**:
  1. **Set 1**: 100 kg × 2 reps (your 2RM), rack the weight, rest 15 seconds.
  2. **Drop to 95 kg**: Perform as many reps as possible (likely 1–2), rest 15 seconds.
  3. **Drop to 90 kg**: Perform another rep or two. If you haven’t reached six total reps, rest 15 seconds and drop again (~85 kg), continuing until you hit a total of six.

Repeat this approach for one primary lift per session (e.g., squat, bench). You might use it once per week for each lift, or as an occasional “finisher” when you need a higher-intensity effort.

---

## Important Notes
- Stick to a strict 5% weight drop each time.  
- Maintain good form—no sloppy reps.  
- Use short, 15-second rest periods to keep intensity high.  
- This is a very demanding technique, so limit its use to one or two key movements in a workout.

---

## Volume Metrics
You’ll typically accumulate one initial “top set” of 2–3 reps, followed by 2–3 drop-sets to reach a total of six reps. In total, it’s 6 near-maximal reps across several rapid-fire micro-sets.

---

## Summary
Ashley Jones’s Strength Drop Set Style is designed to push limits by extending a near-maximal effort across multiple short, high-intensity sets. It’s best suited for more experienced lifters who can handle loads around 90–95% of their 1RM with sound form and a quick drop-set format. Use it sparingly and expect a tough but highly effective strength challenge.

### Overview and Execution

Perform a unilateral exercise (e.g., single-arm dumbbell press). Go to near failure on one arm, then switch immediately to the other. Alternate back and forth with minimal rest until both sides reach their near-failure thresholds. Increase load by 2.5–5 lbs once you surpass your target rep total per side (commonly ~20 reps).

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you stop making progress, adopt a deload week (reduce load ~10–20%) and rebuild.
- You can also slightly increase rest between sides (e.g., 10–15 seconds) if you cannot recover quickly enough to maintain form.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male**:

- Single-arm dumbbell press with 55 lbs for ~10 reps per arm.
- Alternate arms until each arm accumulates ~20 total reps.
- If you easily exceed 20 reps per arm, move to 60 lbs next session.
- If you stall, deload to 50 lbs for a week, then resume progression.

### Important Notes

- Great for accessory or isolation work; advanced lifters sometimes use it for compound lifts.
- Monitor side-to-side strength differences.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies** widely based on how many total reps you perform per limb (often 15–30+ reps per side).

### Summary

Alternating Unilateral Rest-Pause is a quick, effective way to push each limb to near failure while the other arm/leg “rests.” Best for moderate-to-high rep hypertrophy training or bringing up weaker sides.

## Overview and Execution

Daily Max Training mimics aspects of the Bulgarian system, focusing on near-maximal lifts daily or multiple times per week. You ramp up to a heavy single (not necessarily a true 1RM) at RPE 9, then drop down for a few backoff sets at 85–90%.

- **Frequency** can be daily, but that requires advanced recovery strategies.
- **Progression**: If the single feels like RPE 8 or easier, add weight. Otherwise, maintain until it becomes more comfortable.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Reduce Frequency**: If you’re training daily and stall, try 3–4 times per week.
- **Light/Speed Sessions**: Insert lighter days focusing on speed to manage overall fatigue.
- **Deload**: If you continually fail to hit your daily max single at a reasonable RPE, drop intensity for a few sessions.

## Example Application

For an intermediate/advanced 185 lb trainee with a ~300 lb bench press 1RM:

- **Session 1**: Ramp to a single at 265 lb (RPE 9). Then 2 sets of 2 at ~225 lb.
- **Session 2**: If 265 lb feels like RPE 8, go for 270 lb.
- **Session 3**: If it’s still RPE 9, stay with 270 lb until it feels easier. Then increase.
- **Next weeks**: Attempt daily or near-daily, adjusting load by feel. If too taxing, add a lighter speed day.

## Important Notes

- Extremely demanding for CNS and joints if done too frequently.
- Best for advanced lifters who can monitor recovery and technique vigilantly. Beginners may overtrain quickly.

## Volume Metrics

Typically ~4–8 total sets per session, focusing on singles or low reps. Volume is lower to compensate for higher intensity and frequency.

## Summary

Daily Max Training (Bulgarian Adaptation) emphasizes frequent heavy singles to build comfort and skill with maximal loads. While effective for advanced lifters, it requires careful fatigue management and is not recommended for beginners lacking robust recovery capacity.

### Overview and Execution

Load the bar to ~90% of your 1RM. Perform a single rep, rack the bar, rest ~20–30s, then perform another single. Aim for about 5 singles in one cluster. After a cluster, rest 2–3 minutes and repeat as needed for 2–3 clusters. Increase the load slightly (2.5–5 lbs) when you successfully complete all planned singles with good bar speed.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you can’t finish 5 singles per cluster, reduce the load by 5% or lengthen your rest to ~45s between reps.
- Check technique—near-max loads require pristine form.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a ~400 lb squat 1RM:

- Work at ~360 lbs (90%). Perform 1 rep, rest 30s, repeat until you hit 5 singles.
- Rest 3 min, do a second cluster. If you succeed both clusters, next session try 365 lbs.
- If you fail mid-cluster, reduce to 350 lbs next time or extend rest to 45s.

### Important Notes

- This is best for advanced lifters comfortable handling heavy loads.
- Prioritize neural adaptations and technique over volume.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**. Typically 2–3 clusters of ~5 singles = 10–15 total reps.

### Summary

High-intensity cluster singles at 90% 1RM emphasize maximal strength and technical proficiency under heavy load. Ideal for experienced lifters needing to refine heavy-lift performance.

### Overview and Execution

Each minute, perform **2 reps** at roughly **80%** of your 1RM. You have 10 minutes total, so that’s 10 sets of 2 reps (20 total reps). After completing the reps, rest until the top of the next minute. Once you can handle 10 sets without form issues, add a small amount of weight the next session.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you can’t complete all sets with good form, decrease the weight by 5% for the next session and rebuild.
- If you find 80% too challenging, start at 75% until you gain confidence.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 10 x 2 at 185 lb. If sets 9 and 10 still feel crisp, move to 190 lb for the next session.
- **Week 2**: 10 x 2 at 190 lb. If the final set is borderline, repeat 190 lb for another session to ensure mastery before going heavier.

### Important Notes

- Prioritize technique over weight increases.
- Keep rests strict; start exactly when each minute begins.

### Volume Metrics

- **Total volume**: 10 × 2 = 20 reps per session.

### Summary

This EMOM style is great for building both strength and technique consistency. The moderate intensity allows repeated high-quality sets, making it approachable for intermediate lifters looking to reinforce form at a decent load.

### Overview and Execution

This setup calls for **3 reps every minute** using **70–75% of your 1RM**. You’ll complete 10 sets within 10 minutes, for a total of 30 reps. Focus on maintaining a moderate tempo and good form throughout each triple.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If the last sets become too difficult, keep the same weight for the next session until your form and bar speed are solid.
- If you consistently fail the last few sets, reduce the load by 5% and rebuild.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 10 x 3 at 150 lb.
- **Week 2**: If 150 lb felt manageable (no grinding), move to 155 lb.
- **Week 3**: Remain at 155 lb if the last sets are shaky, or increase to 160 lb if they were strong.

### Important Notes

- This module can be taxing because the total rep count is 30 at a moderately heavy load.
- Keep the 1-minute intervals strict to ensure you develop the intended work capacity.

### Volume Metrics

- **Total volume**: 10 × 3 = 30 reps.

### Summary

An effective blend of hypertrophy and strength emphasis, this EMOM is widely used in CrossFit settings. It builds proficiency at midrange percentages while promoting consistent, submaximal technique practice.

### Overview and Execution

Start at **70% of 1RM** (or a moderate load) and perform **1–2 reps each minute**. Every 1–2 minutes, increase the weight in small increments (e.g., +2.5–5%) until you reach around **90%**. This “ladder” approach builds up to heavier loads across the 10-minute EMOM.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail at the higher percentages, reduce that top set by 2–3% next time and focus on nailing the rep with excellent form.
- You may stick with the same increments for multiple sessions until you feel comfortable increasing them again.

### Example Application

- **Minutes 1–2**: 70% (2 reps each minute).
- **Minutes 3–4**: 75% (2 reps each minute).
- **Minutes 5–6**: 80% (1–2 reps each minute).
- **Minutes 7–8**: 85%.
- **Minutes 9–10**: ~90%.
- Adjust the rep count if it becomes too strenuous at higher loads (switch from doubles to singles, for example).

### Important Notes

- Pre-plan your jump increments; avoid large jumps if you’re not confident.
- A spotter or safety setup is recommended as you approach heavier loads.

### Volume Metrics

- You will accumulate **10–20 reps** total, depending on if you’re doing singles or doubles.

### Summary

An ascending-weight EMOM effectively warms you up through moderate loads and culminates in near-maximal singles or doubles. This structure suits intermediate lifters seeking to build comfort with heavier loads in a compressed timeframe.

## Overview and Execution

### Core Concept
- **Sets & Reps**: Perform 3 sets of a particular exercise, beginning with 8 reps each set.  
- **Progression**: Each session, if you complete all reps with good form, you move to the next rep goal:
  1. **3×8** → **3×10** → **3×12**.  
  2. Once 3×12 is achieved, increase the load by 5–10 lb, and reset back to 3×8 at the new weight.
- **Starting Weight**: Pick a weight you can handle comfortably for about 10–12 reps with near-perfect form. That should be roughly 65–75% of your 1RM, though exact percentage can vary.
- **Time per Session**: Typically around 5 minutes for the main movement (excluding warm-ups and any additional exercises), as each set lasts ~30–45 seconds, and rest periods range from ~90–120 seconds.

### Typical Flow
1. **Session 1**: 3×8 with chosen weight. If you get all 8 reps each set without form breakdown, next session is 3×10.  
2. **Session 2**: 3×10 at the same weight. If successful, move to 3×12 next time. If not, keep practicing until you hit 3×10.  
3. **Session 3**: 3×12 at the same weight. Once you can nail all 3 sets of 12, increase the load next session by 5–10 lb.  
4. **Repeat**: Return to 3×8 with the new weight.

---

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

1. **Record & Retry**  
   - If you fail to complete all prescribed reps (e.g., only getting 3×9 when you aimed for 3×10), write down your best numbers.  
   - In the next session, try to exceed those numbers. Continue this until you hit the goal; only then move forward.  
   - If stalled for too long, switch to a similar movement (e.g., flat DB press to incline DB press) or a different progression scheme.

2. **Add a Fourth Set**  
   - If progress is stuck at 3×8, or 3×10, etc., revisit your last successful weight (or a more conservative load).  
   - Bump the sets to 4, working through 4×8 → 4×10 → 4×12. Once you’re back at that stalled point, try reverting to 3 sets again to break through.

3. **Switch Modules Entirely**  
   - If adding sets or retrying isn’t working, you can move on to another structure (e.g., **12–10–8–6**, **5/3/1**, **APRE**, etc.).

## Example Application

Below is a hypothetical 5-week sample progression for an intermediate (185 lb) male lifter on **Incline Dumbbell Bench Press**.

| Week | Weight (Each DB) | Target Reps         | Actual Performance                       | Next Step                                  |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **1** | 50 lb            | 3×8                 | 8, 8, 8 (All reps completed)             | Move to 3×10 next week                     |
| **2** | 50 lb            | 3×10                | 10, 10, 10 (All reps completed)          | Increase target to 3×12                    |
| **3** | 50 lb            | 3×12                | 12, 10, 9 (Missed full reps)             | Retry 3×12 next week (Record performance)  |
| **4** | 50 lb            | 3×12                | 12, 12, 12 (All reps completed)          | Increase weight, drop reps to 3×8          |
| **5** | 55 lb            | 3×8                 | 8, 8, 8 (Just starting new weight)       | Next session → 3×10 @ 55 lb                |

This log shows how you would track progress and decide whether to bump up the reps or the weight. Notice the small 5 lb increment from Week 4 to Week 5 once the lifter mastered 3×12.

---

## Important Notes

- **Weight Selection**: Always begin with a weight you can do for a comfortable 10–12 reps in perfect form.  
- **Form Over Reps**: Don’t sacrifice technique or range of motion just to complete the set.  
- **Recording**: Keep a training log to know precisely which session you reached 3×10, when you got stuck at 3×12, etc.  
- **Variations**: Exercise selection is flexible (presses, rows, squats, etc.); the protocol is the same.

---

## Volume Metrics

- **General Volume**: 3–4 sets of 8–12 reps. This yields 24–36 reps (or more, if using the 4th-set plateau strategy).  
- **Weekly Frequency**: Typically performed once per week for each main exercise; assistance work is optional.

---

### Summary

This 3×8–12 loading module provides a **simple linear progression** strategy: begin at 3×8, progress in reps, then add load when you hit 3×12. If you stall, you have multiple paths to push forward:

1. Retry with the same load until you beat your previous attempt,  
2. Switch the movement or approach, or  
3. Add a fourth set and gradually work back up.

It’s an excellent foundational method for improving muscular endurance and strength over an open-ended cycle, particularly for intermediate lifters looking for a straightforward progression plan.

## Overview and Execution

Perform four total sets per exercise with this framework:

1. **Set 1:** ~12 reps at ~50% of your estimated 10RM  
2. **Set 2:** ~10 reps at ~75% of your estimated 10RM  
3. **Set 3 (AMRAP):** As many reps as possible at your 10RM load  
4. **Set 4 (Adjusted Load):** Choose weight based on Set 3 performance and do another set

For rest, take about **1 minute** between the lighter sets, then **2–5 minutes** before the heavier sets (Sets 3 & 4). This allows partial recovery while preserving enough intensity to hit meaningful rep ranges. The key principle is autoregulation: after each session, the weight for your next workout is determined by how many reps you completed on Set 3.

---

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This APRE method is inherently designed to minimize plateaus because you adjust load based on your performance. If your reps in Set 3 drop unexpectedly, you simply reduce the weight next session. If you exceed target reps, you increase the weight. Below is the **Autoregulation Chart** for reference:

| **Reps in Set 3** | **Next Session Adjustment** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 4–6               | Decrease 5–10 lb           |
| 7–8               | Decrease 0–5 lb            |
| 9–11              | Keep the same weight       |
| 12–16             | Increase 5–10 lb           |
| 17+               | Increase 10–15 lb          |

---

## Example Application

Suppose an intermediate, 185 lb male trainee estimates a **10RM** on squats at **200 lb**:

- **Week 1, Day 1**  
  - **Set 1:** 12 reps at ~100 lb (about 50% of 10RM)  
  - **Set 2:** 10 reps at ~150 lb (about 75% of 10RM)  
  - **Set 3 (AMRAP):** AMRAP at 200 lb; trainee completes 12 reps  
  - **Set 4:** Use the same 200 lb for 8–10 reps (or as many as possible while maintaining form)

  Since the trainee got 12 reps on Set 3 (in the 12–16 range), next session the 10RM load will increase by **5–10 lb** (e.g., from 200 to 205–210 lb).

- **Week 1, Day 2**  
  - Adjust the 10RM load to ~205 lb based on the previous performance.  
  - Repeat the same set structure.  
  - If the trainee still hits ~10–12 reps on Set 3, next time they might increase to 210–215 lb, and so on.

This session-to-session adjustment continues, ensuring progress remains steady without hitting significant plateaus.

---

## Important Notes

- **Choose an accurate 10RM** to start. If you’re unsure, begin with a conservative estimate and adjust upward if you exceed target reps.  
- **Avoid grinding reps**—the goal is steady progression.  
- **Adjust weight up or down** based on performance in Set 3.  
- **Rest more** before heavier sets to maintain rep quality.  
- **Minimal need for deloads**—the autoregulation inherently manages fatigue.

---

## Volume Metrics

You will typically complete **4 working sets** per exercise. The first two sets are relatively lighter (~12 and ~10 reps), followed by an AMRAP set (Set 3) and a final heavy set (Set 4). Overall volume is therefore in the **high-rep** range compared to lower-rep strength programs.

---

## Summary

Thomas DeLorme’s APRE 10RM protocol is an autoregulated approach ideal for **hypertrophy and work capacity**. It dynamically adjusts load based on real-time performance, helping lifters progress consistently without lengthy plateau phases. This method suits beginner-to-intermediate lifters who want higher-rep work and a straightforward, self-correcting way to add intensity over time.

## Overview and Execution

The APRE 3RM module features four main sets, using a true 3RM (a weight where you can perform exactly three reps before failure). The session unfolds as follows:

- **Set 1**: ~50% of your 3RM for 6 reps  
- **Set 2**: ~75% of your 3RM for 3 reps  
- **Set 3**: AMRAP (as many reps as possible) at your current 3RM load  
- **Set 4**: Adjust the weight according to how Set 3 felt or how many reps you achieved

Rest periods scale with intensity and load:
- 1–2 minutes after lighter sets (Sets 1–2)
- 3–5 minutes after heavier sets (Sets 3–4)

This design autoregulates training load. You assess your performance each session and adjust the next session’s 3RM load based on how many reps you achieved in Set 3.

### Performance-to-Load Adjustment Chart

Use the following chart to guide your load for the **next** session:

| **Reps in Set 3** | **Next Session Adjustment** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1–2 reps          | Decrease 5–10 lb           |
| 3–4 reps          | Keep the same weight       |
| 5–6 reps          | Increase 5–10 lb           |
| 7+ reps           | Increase 10–15 lb          |

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you chronically hit only 1–2 reps in Set 3 for several consecutive sessions, consider:
- Reducing your base 3RM weight more substantially
- Adding an extra rest day
- Reviewing technique and recovery factors (sleep, nutrition)
- Lowering accessory volume to prioritize recovery

---

## Example Application

Consider a 185 lb lifter with the following starting 3RMs:
- **Back Squat**: 280 lb
- **Bench Press**: 225 lb
- **Deadlift**: 330 lb

A weekly approach might look like this (showing progression for Back Squat):

**Session 1**  
- Set 1: 6 reps @ ~140 lb (50% of 280)  
- Set 2: 3 reps @ ~210 lb (75% of 280)  
- Set 3: AMRAP @ 280 lb — Suppose 5 reps  
- Set 4: Repeat a heavy triple at ~280–290 lb as you adjust to the new load.  

Next session’s **3RM** increases by 5–10 lb because 5 reps were achieved in Set 3.

**Session 2** (new 3RM ~285 lb)  
- Set 1: 6 reps @ ~140–145 lb  
- Set 2: 3 reps @ ~215 lb  
- Set 3: AMRAP @ 285 lb  
- Set 4: Adjust according to performance  

This pattern continues, adjusting your 3RM weight every session based on the AMRAP result. The bench press and deadlift follow the same template with their respective 3RMs.

---

## Important Notes

- Begin with a **true 3RM**—test or carefully estimate a weight you can only manage for 3 solid reps.  
- Prioritize **explosive and high-quality** reps rather than grinding out poor form.  
- This program **heavily taxes the nervous system** and is best suited for lifters who already have a strong training foundation.  
- Continuous load adjustments help avoid the need for frequent deloads.

---

## Volume Metrics

Each main exercise involves four total sets:
- Approximately **6 + 3 + (3–7) + 3** reps per session, though Set 3 can vary widely based on performance.

---

## Summary

Thomas DeLorme’s APRE 3RM module is a highly effective, autoregulated approach for advanced lifters seeking maximal strength gains. By dynamically adjusting the load after an AMRAP set, it ensures continuous progress without arbitrary weight jumps. This makes it a great choice for powerlifters, strength athletes, and anyone looking to push their 1RM higher through focused, high-intensity training.

## Overview and Execution

The APRE 6RM module consists of four total work sets, each with a specific goal:

1. **Set 1**: 10 reps at approximately 50% of your 6RM.  
2. **Set 2**: 6 reps at approximately 75% of your 6RM.  
3. **Set 3**: AMRAP (as many reps as possible) with a weight near your true 6RM (~85% of 1RM).  
4. **Set 4**: Adjust the load based on Set 3 performance (using the chart below) and perform another set (usually aiming for 6 reps).

Rest intervals scale with intensity:
- **Set 1–2**: ~1–2 minutes  
- **Set 3**: ~2–3 minutes  
- **Set 4**: ~3–5 minutes (heavier, more demanding)

Because this approach is autoregulated, you dynamically adjust the load from one session to the next using the number of reps you achieved in Set 3:

| **Reps in Set 3** | **Next Session Adjustment** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| **0-2 reps**      | Decrease 5-10 lb           |
| **3-4 reps**      | Decrease 0-5 lb            |
| **5-7 reps**      | Keep the same weight       |
| **8-12 reps**     | Increase 5-10 lb           |
| **13+ reps**      | Increase 10-15 lb          |

Focus on compound lifts (squat, deadlift, press, row) or other multi-joint exercises that benefit from progressive overload and autoregulation.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you consistently hit the lower rep ranges (0–2 reps in Set 3) for multiple sessions in a row, you may need to reset your 6RM to a more realistic load. This is an indication that your initial estimate might be too heavy or you need a temporary decrease in training volume/intensity to recover before rebuilding.

---

## Example Application

Here’s how an intermediate (185 lb) lifter might structure the APRE 6RM squat session over several workouts:

- **Workout 1**  
  - Estimated 6RM: 200 lb  
  - Set 1: 10 reps @ 100 lb (50%)  
  - Rest 1–2 min  
  - Set 2: 6 reps @ 150 lb (75%)  
  - Rest 2–3 min  
  - Set 3 (AMRAP): ~8 reps @ 200 lb  
  - Rest 3–5 min  
  - Set 4: Keep the same load (or add 5 lb if desired) based on the 8 reps in Set 3

- **Next Session**  
  - Based on 8 reps, increase next session’s load by 5–10 lb.  
  - Continue the same set/rep scheme.  
  - If eventually you drop down to only 3–4 reps in Set 3, reduce or maintain the load accordingly at the next session.

Over time, you track your progress by the number of reps you achieve in Set 3 and adjust load for the following sessions to ensure continual improvement.

---

## Important Notes

- Identify your **true 6RM** (where you fail at 6 reps with good form) before starting.
- Always track **AMRAP performance** in Set 3 to drive load progression.
- Emphasize **good form**; do not chase extra reps with technique breakdown.
- Rest periods are **longer** on heavier sets to ensure adequate recovery.

---

## Volume Metrics

- **Total Work Sets**: 4
- **Total Reps**: Approximately 20–30 per session for each exercise (e.g., ~10 + 6 + AMRAP + ~6).

---

## Summary

APRE 6RM is a powerful combination of strength and hypertrophy training that adjusts automatically to daily performance fluctuations. Ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters looking to progress without constant 1RM testing, it leverages an AMRAP set to inform how you load the bar in subsequent sessions. The result is a sustainable, responsive training model that helps break plateaus and foster consistent improvement.

## Overview and Execution

Double Progression requires you to progress both in **reps** and in **weight**:

1. Pick a rep range (8–12).
2. Do 3–4 sets, stopping each set at RPE 8.
3. Once you can achieve the upper limit of the rep range (12 reps, for instance) on **all** sets without exceeding RPE 8, you add weight in the next session.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: If you can’t increase reps or the load feels too heavy, do a week with fewer sets or a lower RPE.
- **Adjust Rep Range**: Move from 8–12 to 6–10 if progress slows.

## Example Application

A 185 lb lifter aiming for hypertrophy on bench press:

- **Week 1**: 4×8 at 185 lb. All sets at RPE 8.
- **Week 2**: 4×9 at 185 lb. If the last set is still RPE 8, continue.
- **Week 3**: If you reach 4×12 at RPE ≤8, move to 190 lb next session.

## Important Notes

- Straightforward approach for novice to intermediate lifters who want consistent progress.
- Avoid pushing beyond RPE 8 or the rep cap; the method is about building up to the top end gradually.

## Volume Metrics

Each session is typically 3–4 sets of 8–12 reps, so 24–48 total reps per exercise. This volume can be substantial for hypertrophy.

## Summary

Double Progression with RPE Caps is a simple, linear method that progresses volume first, then intensity. It’s beginner-friendly yet remains effective for intermediate lifters who need an easy-to-track progression strategy without burnout.

## Overview and Execution

### Core Concept
Gironda’s 8×8 method is a **high-volume hypertrophy scheme** focusing on metabolic stress and muscle endurance. You’ll perform:

- **8 sets of 8 reps** at roughly **60-70% of 1RM**.  
- **Short rest intervals of 30 seconds or less** between sets to maximize metabolic stress.
- **Minimal or no training to failure**, prioritizing form and consistent performance across all sets.

### Starting Point & Progression
1. **Choose a load below your true 8RM** (often ~60% 1RM) to ensure you can handle the volume and short rest.  
2. **Aim to complete all 8 sets** without form breakdown.  
3. **Gradually reduce the rest interval** over time (e.g., from 30s to 20s) to drive adaptation.  
4. **Increase load** once you can consistently execute all 8 sets at your target rest interval.

### Time Per Session
- Each movement typically takes **8–9 minutes total**:  
  - **8 sets of work** (~30–45 seconds each, depending on rep speed).  
  - **7 intervals of rest** (30 seconds or less).

---

## Example Application

**For Bench Press**:  
- Start with ~60% of your 1RM — for example, 135 lbs if your 1RM is around 225 lbs.  
- Perform 8 sets of 8 reps, resting 30 seconds between sets.  
- If you consistently complete all sets, add **5–10 lbs** next session.  
- If you miss reps, keep the same weight until you can hit 8×8 with quality form under the prescribed rest.

---

## Important Notes

1. **Avoid Failure**  
   - The goal is cumulative fatigue with short rest, not grinding out maximal lifts.  
   - If you’re losing form, reduce reps *before* reducing weight.

2. **Exercise Selection & Fatigue**  
   - Gironda’s 8×8 can be **highly demanding** on large compound lifts like squats, bench presses, or rows.  
   - **Limit the number of such heavy compound movements** per session to manage overall fatigue.

3. **Progress Gradually**  
   - Start below your 8RM to accommodate minimal rest.  
   - Aim to reduce rest intervals over time (e.g., 30s → 20s → 15s), then increase load once you adapt.

4. **Integration into Larger Programs**  
   - This method isn’t strength-focused; it’s best used within a broader plan aimed at hypertrophy or muscular conditioning.  
   - Ensure you balance it with proper recovery and/or lower-volume strength work in other sessions as needed.

---

## Volume Metrics

- **Per Exercise**:  
  - 8 sets × 8 reps = 64 total reps.

- **Session Time** (per exercise):  
  - ~8–9 minutes including short rest intervals.

---

## Summary

Gironda’s 8×8 is a **classic high-volume hypertrophy protocol** designed to produce a potent metabolic challenge within a short time frame. By keeping rest intervals at 30 seconds (or less) and sticking to 8 sets of 8 reps, you encourage muscle endurance, improved work capacity, and significant muscle “pump.” Starting with a modest load ensures you can complete each set without failing; then, the progression comes from **shortening rest** and **eventually increasing weight**.

This approach is ideal for lifters seeking a **high-density**, short-duration workout module. However, be mindful of the **high cumulative fatigue** it generates, and adjust your overall program volume and exercise selection to avoid excessive overlap of intense compound movements.

### Overview and Execution

GZCLP Tier 1 involves heavy barbell lifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press) performed in a wave-like progression. You begin with **5×3+** (last set AMRAP) and add weight each session until failing the “base volume” of 15 total reps. Once you can’t complete 15, drop to **6×2+**. Continue until failing the new base (12 reps). Then move to **10×1+** until failing 10 reps. After this final stage, rest a couple of days, test a new 5RM, and restart at ~85% of that new 5RM. The last set is typically an AMRAP but avoid grinding out to true failure—aim to leave 1–2 reps in the tank.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- When you cannot reach the required “base volume” (15, 12, or 10 total reps), **switch** to the next wave (3→2→1 reps per set).
- After failing at 10×1+, you **deload** by testing a new 5RM and restarting the cycle at about 85% of that value.

### Example Application

Suppose a 185 lb lifter starts Squat T1 at **185 lb** for 5×3+. Each session, they add **10 lb** and attempt 5×3. Once they can’t reach 15 total reps, they switch to 6×2+ with that same top weight and continue adding 10 lb each new session until failing 12 reps total. They then move to 10×1+ and keep increasing by 10 lb until they fail to hit 10 singles. At that point, they rest a few days, test a new 5RM, and resume at ~85% of that tested max.

### Important Notes

- **Don’t** push AMRAP sets much beyond ~10 reps; keep 1–2 reps in reserve.
- Once you miss the target base volume, drop to the next rep wave.
- Prioritize form and adequate rest (3–5 minutes) between sets.

### Volume Metrics

Depending on where you are in the wave:

- **5×3:** 15 total reps
- **6×2:** 12 total reps
- **10×1:** 10 total reps

### Summary

GZCLP Tier 1 is designed for **novice to intermediate lifters** seeking a structured approach to extend linear progress. It uses wave loading to sustain gains longer than a simple 5×5 or 3×5. The tier resets after each fail point, providing a built-in progression and deload strategy.

### Overview and Execution

Tier 2 in GZCLP provides additional volume at **moderate intensities**. You start with **3×10** and add a little weight each session (e.g., 5 lb upper, 10 lb lower). Once you can’t complete **30 reps** total, switch to **3×8** and repeat. After you stall on **24 reps** total, drop to **3×6**. When you fail to meet **18 reps**, restart the cycle (back at 3×10) with a slightly heavier starting weight than before.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you miss the target total reps (30, 24, or 18), move down to the next rep bracket (10 → 8 → 6).
- Once you fail 3×6, reset to 3×10 with a modest weight increase.

### Example Application

An intermediate lifter might run **T2 Bench** at 135 lb for 3×10. Each T2 session, add 5 lb (140, 145, etc.). If they fail to hit 30 total reps, they move to 3×8 at that weight. After they fail at 24 total reps, they drop to 3×6, keep adding 5 lb each session until failing 18 total reps, then reset.

### Important Notes

- Use **2–3 minutes** rest between sets to maintain form.
- Once you stall, reduce reps and keep progressing weight.
- This approach provides volume to support your T1 lifts.

### Volume Metrics

- Range is typically **3×10** (30 reps) → **3×8** (24 reps) → **3×6** (18 reps).

### Summary

GZCLP Tier 2 is a **secondary loading module** aimed at building volume and supporting the primary lifts. By gradually lowering the rep range each time you stall, you maximize progression while giving yourself a clear fallback plan when sets become too challenging.

### Overview and Execution

GZCLP Tier 3 focuses on **accessory exercises** (e.g., lat pulldowns, dumbbell rows) performed for higher reps. Do **3×15** with the **last set as an AMRAP**. Once you reach about 25 reps on the last set, add weight for the next workout. Rest around 1–1.5 minutes between sets, aiming for controlled movement and strict form.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

Not typically addressed here—if you can’t achieve 15 reps on the first two sets or can’t progress to 25 on the AMRAP, consider dropping the weight slightly or adding another session or two at the same load until you adapt.

### Example Application

If you start lat pulldowns at **60 lb** for 15, 15, and 20 reps (on the last set), keep that load until the final set reaches **25** reps. Then, increase to **65 lb** next session and repeat. Over a few weeks, your final set might climb from 20 → 22 → 25, triggering your next weight jump.

### Important Notes

- Focus on **form** over load, as accessories target hypertrophy and movement patterning.
- Leave 1–2 reps in reserve, don’t push to absolute failure on the AMRAP.

### Volume Metrics

- Each session is **3×15**, with the last set often exceeding 15 (AMRAP) until 25 reps are reached.

### Summary

GZCLP Tier 3 complements the heavy T1 and moderate T2 work with **high-rep accessory exercises**, promoting muscular endurance and size. This tier is especially helpful for building back strength and addressing weak points without overly taxing the central nervous system.

## Overview and Execution

Autoregulatory Progressive Volume has you begin each session with a baseline set count (e.g., 3) at RPE 7. If you complete the baseline without exceeding RPE 7, you add another set. You keep adding sets until RPE 8 is reached.

- **Load Increases**: When you can do all baseline sets at ≤RPE 7, bump up the weight next session.
- This approach adapts session volume to how strong/energetic you feel that day.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: Start at fewer sets if you’re burned out or exceed RPE 8 too soon.
- **Adjust Rep Range**: If stalling, shift from 6–10 reps to a different range for variety.

## Example Application

A 185 lb intermediate focusing on overhead press might do:

- **Week 1**: 3×8 at 115 lb, RPE 7 on all sets, so add a 4th set. If that 4th set hits RPE 8, stop.
- **Next Week**: If 3 sets at 115 lb remain at RPE 7 or below, try 120 lb. If it jumps above RPE 8 quickly, you may drop back to 115 lb or recheck form.

## Important Notes

- Great for hypertrophy or general strength because you self-regulate volume.
- Keep a close eye on RPE ratings—over- or under-estimating can change your volume dramatically.

## Volume Metrics

Volume can vary day to day. Typically 3–5+ sets of 6–10 reps, adjusting as performance dictates.

## Summary

APV dynamically adjusts set count to your daily performance. It ensures you do enough work on “good days” and manage volume on “tough days,” making it ideal for intermediate lifters seeking balanced progress without a strict set prescription.

### Overview and Execution

Set a 15-minute timer. Each minute, perform **5 reps** at **50–60%** of your 1RM, then rest until the next minute starts. This is higher-volume, moderate-intensity work, ideal for hypertrophy and building work capacity. If 15 total sets is too demanding, begin with fewer (10 or 12) and add sets each session.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you can’t complete 5 reps by the final sets, lower the weight 5% or reduce the total minutes to 10 or 12 for a period.
- Once you can do 15 x 5 comfortably, add 2.5–5 lb and repeat the process.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 10 minutes at 115 lb (5 reps/min) = 10 sets total.
- **Week 2**: 12 minutes at 115 lb, still 5 reps each minute.
- **Week 3**: 15 minutes at 115 lb = 75 reps. If successful, next session is 120 lb starting at 10 minutes again.

### Important Notes

- Expect significant fatigue near the end. Focus on consistent technique and tempo.
- Keep your rest strict—start each set exactly when the minute begins.

### Volume Metrics

- **15 sets × 5 reps** = 75 total reps.

### Summary

Designed primarily for hypertrophy and muscular endurance, this EMOM’s fairly high volume at moderate intensity helps new-to-intermediate lifters build size and conditioning. Adjust the total time or load to manage fatigue and progress steadily.

## Overview and Execution

Fatigue-Stop Sets use a moderate intensity (about 70% 1RM) for a few straight sets, then a final AMRAP set stopping at RPE 9:

1. Perform 3 sets of 8 at ~70%.
2. On the 4th set, do as many reps as possible but do **not** go to absolute failure; stop around RPE 9.
3. If you exceed your target by a good margin (e.g., 4+ extra reps), you’ll increase weight next time.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: Drop intensity 5–10% or reduce the rep target for a week if your AMRAP set stagnates or becomes too hard.
- **Vary Rep Ranges**: Switch from 8s to 6s while keeping the same method.

## Example Application

For a 185 lb lifter with a ~365 lb squat 1RM (70% ~255 lb):

- **Week 1**: 3×8 @ 255 lb, then final AMRAP set. If you hit 12 reps on that last set, note it.
- **Week 2**: If you consistently get 10+ reps on the final set, move to 260 lb.
- **Week 3**: If you can no longer exceed 8 reps, consider a small deload or rep-range shift.

## Important Notes

- Great for tracking progress because the final AMRAP set acts as a performance indicator.
- Avoid hitting true failure: stopping at RPE 9 helps manage fatigue and recovery.

## Volume Metrics

Typically 4 sets total at 8 reps each, plus potential extra reps on the last set. So roughly 32+ reps.

## Summary

Fatigue-Stop Sets, used in the Juggernaut Method, allow you to gauge progress with a near-to-failure final set. It works well for intermediate lifters aiming to balance volume, intensity, and progression without regularly overreaching.

### Overview and Execution

This approach is a **3/2/1 wave** repeated **3 times**, each wave occupying 3 consecutive minutes. In minute one, you do 3 reps at a moderate load (around 70–74% of 1RM, depending on the wave). Next minute is 2 reps at a slightly heavier weight, and the third minute is 1 rep at the heaviest load of that wave. Repeat for a total of 3 waves (9 minutes).

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail on a single or the set feels near failure, lower your top weight by 2–3% next time.
- You can also reduce the total waves from 3 down to 2 if the last wave is too difficult, then work back up.

### Example Application

- **Wave 1**:
    - Minute 1: 3 reps at 70%
    - Minute 2: 2 reps at 75%
    - Minute 3: 1 rep at 80%
- **Wave 2**:
    - Minute 4: 3 reps at 72%
    - Minute 5: 2 reps at 77%
    - Minute 6: 1 rep at 82%
- **Wave 3**:
    - Minute 7: 3 reps at 74%
    - Minute 8: 2 reps at 79%
    - Minute 9: 1 rep at 84%

For an intermediate 185 lb lifter with an estimated 1RM of 300 lb on a squat or bench, these percentages translate to incrementally heavier loads on each wave.

### Important Notes

- Proper form is critical; as intensity rises each wave, avoid letting technique slip.
- Ensure rest for the remainder of each minute after your reps—recovery is key to hitting the next wave effectively.

### Volume Metrics

- **9 sets total** across 3 waves of 3/2/1, equaling **18 reps** in total.

### Summary

Wave EMOMs blend moderate to heavy loads in short bursts, progressively intensifying each wave. This structure trains the lifter to handle heavier loads in a condensed timeframe, enhancing both strength and technique under fatigue.

### Overview and Execution

Perform **1–2 reps on the minute** for 20 minutes straight, using **70–80%** of your 1RM. This extended EMOM builds both skill under load and total volume. If 20 sets is overwhelming, reduce to 15 sets and build up.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail to maintain form or can’t complete the full 20 sets, scale back to 15 sets or drop the weight by 5%.
- Gradually add small weight increments or transition from 1 rep to 2 reps if it becomes too easy.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 20 x 1 at 185 lb for a total of 20 reps.
- **Week 2**: If sets remain strong, attempt 20 x 2 at 185 lb = 40 total reps.
- **Week 3**: If technique still holds, add 5 lb and repeat 20 x 1 or 2 as appropriate.

### Important Notes

- Stay mindful of fatigue over such a long series of sets; maintain consistent technique.
- If time or stamina is limited, use a 15-minute version first.

### Volume Metrics

- **20 sets × 1–2 reps** = **20–40 total reps** per session.

### Summary

A longer EMOM module suitable for lifters aiming to improve work capacity and technique under moderate loads. It can be adjusted easily by changing the total sets (time) or reps, making it useful for building confidence with a moderately heavy weight over many sets.

### Overview and Execution

Pick a single moderate-to-heavy weight. Start with the most challenging position or grip, performing 6–8 reps. Without resting, shift to a stronger position (slightly narrower or more neutral grip) and go to failure. Finally, shift to your strongest position (often the narrowest or most mechanically efficient) and do as many reps as possible. Once you comfortably exceed 8 reps in the weakest position, increase the overall load.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you plateau, consider adding a fourth position (if applicable) or adding partial reps at the final strongest position.
- You can also slightly lengthen rest intervals (10–15 seconds) between transitions, but the classic approach uses minimal rest.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**:
    
    - **Biceps**:
        1. Wide-grip barbell curls × 6 reps
        2. Narrower standard grip to failure
        3. Close grip to failure
    - 1–2 minutes rest, then repeat for another round if desired.
- **Week 2+**:
    
    - If you hit 8+ reps on the wide-grip, bump your starting weight by 5 lb.

### Important Notes

Keep transitions quick. Use good form throughout, especially as you fatigue in later grips. This is a highly fatiguing method for targeted muscle groups, so factor in adequate recovery.

### Volume Metrics

Three “phases” each round (weak → standard → strongest). You might do 1–2 rounds per exercise.

### Summary

Mechanical Advantage Drop Sets let you continue pushing a muscle group without changing the weight, leveraging progressively stronger mechanical positions. Great for variety and hypertrophy, but be mindful of recovery due to the high fatigue nature.

### Overview and Execution

Perform an “activation set” of 12–20 reps near failure. Rest ~20 seconds, then do a mini-set of 3–5 reps. Rest another 20 seconds, continue with 3–5 reps, and repeat until you can’t complete at least 3 reps. Increase weight 2.5–5 lbs when you easily reach the upper end of your total rep range (e.g., 20–25 combined reps).

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you stop seeing progression, switch exercises or adjust the rep range (e.g., do 10–15 reps or 15–20 reps).
- Alternatively, reduce load by 5–10% and rebuild volume.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** using Leg Press:

- Start with 250 lbs for ~15 reps, rest 20s, then 4 reps, rest 20s, 4 reps, rest 20s, 3 reps… until you can’t get 3.
- If you exceed 20 total reps, move up to 260 lbs next session.
- If you fail to get a quality activation set, reduce to 240 lbs.

### Important Notes

- Works well with machines or safe free-weight movements (like a Smith machine).
- The short rests maximize muscle fiber recruitment without heavy overall fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**. Typically 1 activation set plus 2–4 mini-sets of 3–5 reps.

### Summary

Myo-Reps target high muscle fiber recruitment via brief rest intervals and repeated near-failure efforts. It’s popular for hypertrophy and time-efficiency in moderate rep ranges.

---

### Overview and Execution

This module employs wave loading where you alternate a heavy triple with a supramaximal eccentric single. Each “wave” consists of:

1. **Set of 3 reps** at near-max load (the third rep should be very challenging, but doable in good form).  
2. **Rest** 2–3 minutes.  
3. **Single Eccentric-Only Rep** at ~10% more than your triple. Lower the weight under control for 8–10 seconds.  
4. **Rest** another 2–3 minutes.  

Repeat for 3 total waves. Each wave benefits from the previous set’s post-tetanic facilitation, allowing for slight load increases if you remain within safe form and tempo standards.

---

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

No specific plateau strategies are mentioned. If you fail to maintain the 8–10 second negative or cannot complete the triple with proper form, reduce the load slightly or allow for longer rest periods between sets. Continue refining weight selection to maintain the prescribed tempos and rep counts.

---

### Example Application

Below is a practical multi-session layout for an intermediate 185 lb lifter whose 3-rep max (3RM) on the bench press is 225 lbs:

- **Session 1 (Wave 1)**:  
  - 3 reps @ 225 lbs, rest ~2 min  
  - 1 eccentric-only rep @ 245 lbs (8–10 second negative), rest ~2 min  
  - (Wave 2) 3 reps @ 230 lbs, 1 eccentric-only rep @ 250 lbs  
  - (Wave 3) 3 reps @ 235 lbs, 1 eccentric-only rep @ 255 lbs  

- **Session 2** (next bench workout) might start slightly higher if the lifts felt strong, e.g., 3 reps @ 230, single @ 250, etc.

Over multiple weeks, you can repeat this pattern and adjust loads slightly each session, provided you keep the descent controlled on the eccentric rep and the triple remains near-max effort but maintainable.

---

### Important Notes

- Stop the eccentric single if the negative speed drops under 8 seconds, or if form breaks down.  
- If the triple feels too easy, add 2–5% more weight in the subsequent wave. If it’s too hard, lower the load or increase rest.  
- Keep rest periods at 2–3 minutes (or longer, if necessary) to ensure quality heavy lifts.

---

### Volume Metrics

- **Per Session**: 6 total sets (3 heavy triples + 3 single negatives)  
- **Total Reps**: 12 (9 reps from the triples + 3 eccentric-only singles)  

---

### Summary

Poliquin’s “3 Then 1” Eccentric Wave Method is an advanced loading strategy that pairs heavy triples with supramaximal eccentric singles. The combination harnesses post-tetanic facilitation to rapidly boost strength and functional hypertrophy. It’s best for intermediate to advanced lifters who can handle intense loads and precise tempo work. By cycling through three “waves” in each session, you’ll challenge your nervous system to adapt quickly, leading to notable gains in both strength and size.

## Overview and Execution

This module uses a **cluster set** strategy to help you complete 8 total reps with a weight you’d normally handle for only 5 reps (your 5RM). You perform your first 5 reps consecutively, then insert short intra-set rests of about 15 seconds to squeeze in 3 additional single reps. Each session includes three total “5-to-8” sets, separated by 3–5 minutes of rest.

- **Select your load**: Typically around 85% of 1RM (your 5RM), though some may start closer to their 6RM if they want to be conservative.  
- **Perform 5 reps**, rack the bar, rest **15 seconds**.  
- **Perform 1 rep**, rack, rest **15 seconds**.  
- **Perform 1 rep**, rack, rest **15 seconds**.  
- **Perform 1 final rep** for 8 total.  

If you successfully complete all 8 reps in all 3 sets, add about 5 lbs in your next session. Do not take any of these reps to failure; focus on crisp technique.

---

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you fail to hit all 8 reps during your sets, simply try to beat your previous performance in the next session (e.g., complete an extra rep you missed). Keep the load the same until you can hit the full 8 reps for 3 sets, then add a small increment.

---

## Example Application

Let’s assume an intermediate lifter (185 lbs bodyweight) has a **205 lb bench press** for 5 reps. Over a brief 3-week cycle, here’s how it might look:

- **Week 1**:  
  - **Set 1**: 5 reps at 205, rest 15s, 1 rep, rest 15s, 1 rep, rest 15s, 1 rep (total 8).  
  - **Set 2**: Same as above.  
  - **Set 3**: Same as above.  
  - If all 8 reps are hit on all 3 sets, progress next week.  

- **Week 2**:  
  - Increase to **210 lbs**. Perform the same 3 cluster sets. If you miss any single reps, retry 210 lbs next session.  
  - If you do complete all sets, you can bump up to 215 lbs.

- **Week 3**:  
  - Attempt **215 lbs** using the same protocol. If you succeed, you may choose to continue adding weight or transition to a new phase after 2–4 total weeks to avoid burnout.

---

## Important Notes

- **Avoid failure**: Keep at least 1–2 reps in reserve for each main set. If you begin to break form or grind excessively, terminate the set.  
- Keep your **rest intervals** short (15 seconds) for the single reps—do not “linger” or the method’s effect diminishes.  
- **Limit usage** to 2–4 weeks before switching strategies or deloading.

---

## Volume Metrics

For the primary lift, each cluster equates to 8 total reps. With 3 such sets, you’ll achieve **24 total reps** at or near your 5RM intensity. This is relatively high volume for such a heavy load, which is why the short cycle duration is recommended.

---

## Summary

The **5-to-8 Method** offers a potent way to break through strength plateaus by slightly extending your usual rep range at a challenging load. By leveraging short, intra-set rests, you push beyond normal fatigue limits without training to failure. It's best suited for intermediate lifters who have established their 5RM and need a short, intense phase to spur strength gains. Limit the method to 2–4 weeks, monitor fatigue, and progress weight in small increments for steady improvements.

## Overview and Execution

Wave Loading with Autoregulation typically runs in cycles of decreasing reps (e.g., 6–4–2) while increasing weight each set. Once you finish a “wave,” you start the next wave at a slightly higher weight—provided your RPE targets align.

- **Wave 1**: 6 reps (RPE 7), 4 reps (RPE 8), 2 reps (RPE 9).
- **Wave 2**: Increase weight if the first wave felt manageable; keep RPE 7–9 in each set.
- **Stop** if RPE jumps too high or your technique falters.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: If waves become too challenging, reduce top-end intensity or skip the final 2-rep portion.
- **Accumulation**: Focus on more volume in the 6-rep range for a few sessions before returning to heavier waves.

## Example Application

For an intermediate 185 lb lifter with a ~315 lb squat max:

- **Wave 1**:
    - 6 reps @ 225 lb (RPE 7),
    - 4 reps @ 245 lb (RPE 8),
    - 2 reps @ 265 lb (RPE 9).
- **Wave 2**: Increase each step by 5 lb if the first wave was comfortable.
- **Next Weeks**: Keep adding small increments when RPE stays below targets; reduce if you overshoot.

## Important Notes

- RPE-based wave loading requires honesty in rating how difficult each set is.
- Each wave is meant to push slightly beyond the previous wave’s load if your readiness is good.

## Volume Metrics

A two-wave session typically yields 24 total reps (6+4+2 × 2). You can do more or fewer waves depending on time and recovery.

## Summary

Wave Loading with Autoregulation hits multiple intensity zones within one session, fostering both strength and hypertrophy. It is best suited for intermediate to advanced lifters who can manage heavier sets at varying rep ranges and properly gauge RPE.

### Overview and Execution

Use a weight close to your **3RM** (about 90% of 1RM). Perform 3 reps, rack the bar, rest for ~30 seconds, then do mini-sets of 2 reps with 30 seconds rest until you can no longer complete 2 reps. After that, finish with singles (1 rep) until failure, still resting ~30 seconds between reps. Once you reach a total of about 10 reps, increase the load by 2.5–5 lbs in the next session.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you repeatedly fail to reach your rep target, drop the load by ~10% and rebuild.
- You could also extend the rest from 30 seconds to 45 seconds for a session or two.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a ~300 lb 1RM bench press, the 3RM might be around 270 lbs.

- Perform 3 reps at 270 lbs, rest 30s, then sets of 2 reps until you can’t get 2. After that, do singles.
- If you total ~10 reps (e.g., 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1), next session try 275 lbs.
- If you fail earlier than expected, reduce to ~260 lbs next time and build back up.

### Important Notes

- Strict form is crucial—rest-pause with near-max loads can quickly lead to sloppy technique if not monitored.
- Keep volume under control to avoid excessive fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**, depending on how many mini-sets you achieve. Typically ranges between 6–12 total reps.

### Summary

This rest-pause method intensifies your 3RM training by letting you squeeze extra reps from heavy loads. It’s best suited for intermediate-to-advanced lifters needing a novel stimulus to break strength plateaus on key lifts.

### Overview and Execution

Select a weight for ~8 reps to failure. After reaching failure, rest 15 seconds (rest-pause), drop weight by 10–15%, and do another AMRAP set to failure. Rest 15 seconds again, drop another 10–15%, and do a final set to failure. Increase your starting weight when you can exceed 10 reps on the first set.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- Insert a deload week if you continuously fail to progress or feel overly taxed. Reduce the top weight by ~10–20%.
- Adjust the drop percentages if you’re hitting too few reps after each drop.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** on dumbbell shoulder press:

- Start at 60 lb dumbbells for 8 reps to failure, rest 15s, drop to 50 lb dumbbells, do AMRAP, rest 15s, drop to 40 lb, AMRAP.
- If you hit 10 reps initially, move to 65 lb dumbbells next time.
- Deload to 55 lb if you stall for multiple sessions.

### Important Notes

- This method is very taxing. Make sure to limit usage to 1–2 exercises per session.
- Be mindful of form under fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**. Typically 1 extended drop set with 2–3 total drops, each to failure.

### Summary

Combining rest-pause with drop sets brings extreme intensity for hypertrophy. Best for advanced bodybuilders looking to push a muscle group to its limit, but requires careful volume management.

### Overview and Execution

Reverse Drop Sets start with a high-rep, lower-weight set to induce early fatigue. Then you increase weight and drop the rep count. For example, do 15–20 reps, add 10–20% weight for 10–12 reps, and add another 10–20% for 6–8 reps to failure. Progress by raising your initial (lightest) weight once you comfortably exceed the top of each rep range.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- Not explicitly stated, but if you stall at the heavier sets, consider smaller weight jumps or incorporate partial reps at the end.
- You could also slightly reduce your first set’s rep target to conserve energy for the heavier sets.

### Example Application

**Week 1** (Leg Extensions):

- 60 lb × 15–20 reps
- 70 lb × 10–12 reps
- 80 lb × 6–8 reps (to failure)

If you manage 20 reps on the first set and 8 reps on the last, move all weights up by 5 lb next session.

### Important Notes

- The final heavy set goes to failure, so be mindful of form to avoid injury.
- You can apply this method to isolation movements (like leg curls or triceps pushdowns) or even certain machine-based compound exercises.

### Volume Metrics

You typically do 3 working sets, hitting high reps on the first set and ramping up weight as reps decrease.

### Summary

Reverse Drop Sets hit multiple rep ranges in one session, potentially targeting different muscle fiber types. This method suits bodybuilders and intermediate lifters looking for a varied stimulus within a short timeframe.

## Overview and Execution

RIR Progression sets a fixed number of sets/reps (e.g., 4×10) with a target “Reps in Reserve” (RIR), commonly 2 RIR. If you finish sets with more than 2 RIR, it’s time to increase the weight.

- **Load Selection**: Pick a weight you can handle at 2 RIR for all sets.
- **Progression**: Once the exercise becomes easier (3+ RIR), add weight.
- **Regression**: If it’s too hard (≤1 RIR), reduce weight or reps.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: Drop to 8 reps or reduce sets for a week if you’re stuck.
- **Reset the Weight**: If your RIR is too low, step back and rebuild.

## Example Application

For a 185 lb lifter benching ~225 lb for 10 reps:

- **Week 1**: 4×10 at 205 lb, leaving ~2 RIR each set.
- **Week 2**: If on the 4th set you feel you still have 3+ reps left, move to 210 lb next session.
- **Ongoing**: Each time sets get easier than 2 RIR, bump weight 5–10 lb.

## Important Notes

- Success relies on accurately assessing RIR. Overestimation leads to under-loading; underestimation can cause overreach.
- Great for hypertrophy, general strength, and novices who prefer a simpler autoregulation system.

## Volume Metrics

Commonly ~4 sets × 10 reps = 40 total reps. Adjust sets/reps based on goals (e.g., 3×8 at 2 RIR).

## Summary

RIR Progression is an accessible autoregulation technique. By targeting a specific number of reps in reserve, you maintain consistent effort across sessions, increasing load only when you’re truly ready to handle more weight.

## Overview and Execution

The RPE-Based Top Set with Backoff Sets approach involves selecting a single “top set” at RPE 8 (meaning you should have about 2 reps left in the tank). After that top set, you perform multiple backoff sets—typically at about 90% of the weight used in your top set—for the same rep count.

- **Progression**: If your top set felt like RPE 7.5 or lower, add a small amount of weight (2.5–5 lb) next session.
- **If Overly Challenging**: If the top set is above RPE 8, hold the weight steady until it becomes easier.
- **Deload**: Lower the target RPE or change the rep range to reduce intensity and volume temporarily when needed.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: If the RPE is creeping above 8 for multiple sessions, drop your top set RPE target to 7 for a week or change your rep scheme (e.g., move from sets of 5 to sets of 4).
- **Focus on Technique**: During a plateau, ensure your form is solid at slightly lower intensities before ramping back up.

## Example Application

For an intermediate 185 lb lifter whose squat 1RM is around 315 lb:

- **Week 1**: Top set of 5 reps at 235 lb (RPE 8). Four backoff sets at ~210–215 lb.
- **Week 2**: If Week 1 felt manageable (RPE ~7.5), increase top set to 240 lb, backoffs at ~215–220 lb.
- **Week 3**: If top set starts to feel like RPE 8.5, hold that weight until it’s back to RPE 8 or lower.
- **Week 4**: If progression stalls, deload by reducing top set weight to an RPE 7 or moving to 4-rep sets.

## Important Notes

- Be honest with RPE. Overestimating or underestimating can skew progression.
- Adjust rest times as needed (2–3 minutes for top sets, 1–2 minutes for backoffs) to keep quality high.

## Volume Metrics

With a single top set plus four backoff sets of 5, total volume is 5×5 = 25 reps. This remains relatively constant across sessions (unless you change rep count or add sets).

## Summary

“RPE-Based Top Set with Backoff Sets” is a flexible, autoregulated module. It provides both a heavy stimulus from the top set and volume stimulus from backoffs. Ideal for novice to advanced lifters who want day-to-day tuning of intensity while maintaining consistency in volume.

## Overview and Execution

The PT Pyramid is a bodyweight endurance workout designed to enhance muscular stamina and cardiovascular fitness. You begin at Step 1 with 1 pullup, 2 pushups, and 3 situps. Each subsequent step increases reps proportionally: pullups by 1, pushups by 2, and situps by 3. Continue ascending until Step 10, where you perform 10 pullups, 20 pushups, and 30 situps. After a 1-minute rest at the peak, descend the pyramid in reverse, reducing reps at each step until you return to Step 1.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This module is primarily endurance-based and not designed for progressive overload in the traditional strength sense. However, if you plateau or struggle to complete the full pyramid, consider reducing the top step (e.g., only going to Step 8) and progressively working back up to Step 10 over time.

## Example Application

An intermediate male trainee (185 lbs) might complete the full pyramid in 30 minutes. For example, in Week 1, he completes Steps 1-10 and back down without assistance. If pullups become challenging, he can use TRX bands for assistance. By Week 4, he should aim to complete the pyramid faster, reducing rest between exercises.

## Important Notes

- Do not perform this workout more than twice a week to avoid overtraining.
- Modify difficulty by using TRX for assistance or to increase resistance.
- Maintain minimal rest between exercises to maximize endurance benefits.

## Volume Metrics

Total volume per session includes:
- **100 pullups**
- **200 pushups**
- **300 situps**

## Summary

The PT Pyramid is an effective bodyweight circuit designed to build muscular endurance and stamina. Its pyramid structure naturally incorporates warmup, peak effort, and cooldown phases. Ideal for individuals seeking to improve PT scores or overall endurance, it’s best suited for intermediate trainees looking to enhance their bodyweight exercise capacity.

### Overview and Execution

Escalating Density Training (EDT) focuses on maximizing the total number of reps performed in a fixed 15-minute window. Choose two exercises that target opposing muscle groups (e.g., pushing and pulling). Use your 10RM load for both movements.

**Execution Steps:**
1. Set a timer for 15 minutes.
2. Alternate between the two exercises, performing up to 5 reps per set.
3. Rest minimally (15-30 seconds) between sets.
4. As fatigue accumulates, reduce reps per set as needed while maintaining good form.
5. Aim to beat your previous session’s total rep count by at least one rep.

---

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you find yourself unable to increase the total reps for 2-3 consecutive sessions, consider the following strategies:
- **Reduce Rest:** Shorten rest intervals between sets.
- **Change Rep Scheme:** Drop to sets of 3 reps, focusing on faster set transitions.
- **Swap Exercises:** Rotate in similar but different exercises to stimulate new adaptations.
- **Deload:** Take a lighter session to recover, then push harder the following week.

---

### Example Application

For an intermediate trainee weighing 185 lbs:

**Session 1:**
- **Exercise 1:** Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press (10RM = 50 lbs)
- **Exercise 2:** Lat Pulldown (10RM = 120 lbs)

- **Minutes 0-5:** Perform 5 reps per set, completing 3-4 sets of each.
- **Minutes 5-10:** Adjust to 4 reps per set, completing 3-4 sets.
- **Minutes 10-15:** Drop to 3 reps per set, completing as many sets as possible.

**Total Reps:**
- Shoulder Press: ~42 reps
- Lat Pulldown: ~42 reps

**Session 2:**
- Aim for at least 43 reps per exercise.

Continue progressing until total reps improve by 20%, then increase the load by 2.5-5%.

---

### Important Notes

- Perform **up to 5 reps per set**, even if capable of more.
- **Adjust reps down** as fatigue sets in, but maintain good form.
- **Rest minimally** between sets (15-30 seconds).
- **Progress by increasing total reps** each session.
- **Increase weight by 2.5-5%** once total reps improve by 20% over the initial session.

---

### Volume Metrics

- Typically **40-50 total reps per exercise** in the 15-minute session.

---

### Summary

Staley’s EDT 15-Minute PR Zone is an efficient, high-intensity module ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters seeking strength and hypertrophy gains. By focusing on density rather than just load, it fosters progressive overload and mental toughness. The module’s autoregulated nature makes it adaptable, while its simplicity makes it easy to integrate into various training programs.

### Overview and Execution

This module focuses on maximizing work density within a strict 15-minute window using two antagonistic exercises. Begin with a thorough warm-up and identify your 6RM (six-rep max) load for each exercise. Start a timer for 15 minutes and alternate between the two movements, performing **up to 3 reps per set**. As fatigue builds, drop to 2 or even 1 rep per set, but **never exceed 3 reps**. Rest periods should be minimal—just enough to maintain good form.

The goal is to accumulate as many high-quality reps as possible within the time limit. After completing the session, **record the total reps** for each exercise. This becomes your baseline Personal Record (PR). In subsequent sessions, aim to beat this total by even a single rep. Once you can exceed your initial PR by around **20%**, increase the load by **2.5-5%** and set a new PR target.

---

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you hit a plateau and can't beat your previous PR, here are strategies to break through:

1. **Reduce Rest Periods:** Shorten the time between exercises to increase overall density.
2. **Adjust Rep Scheme:** Alternate between 3-rep clusters and 2-rep clusters to introduce variability.
3. **Modify Exercises:** Slightly change the movement pattern (e.g., from barbell shoulder press to dumbbell press) for a new stimulus.
4. **Wave Loading:** Reduce the weight by 5-10% and aim for a higher total rep count before returning to heavier loads.

### Example Application

**Intermediate Example (185 lbs Male Trainee):**

- **Shoulder Press:** 6RM = 135 lbs
- **Lat Pulldown:** 6RM = 180 lbs

| Minute | Shoulder Press Reps | Lat Pulldown Reps |

| 10     | 1                   | 1                |
| 11     | 1                   | 1                |
| 12     | 1                   | 1                |
| 13     | 1                   | 1                |
| 14     | 1                   | 1                |
| 15     | 1                   | 1                |

- **Total Shoulder Press Reps:** 26  
- **Total Lat Pulldown Reps:** 30

In the next session, aim to beat these totals by even 1 rep. Once you can consistently exceed these numbers by 20%, increase the weight slightly.

---

### Important Notes

- **Never exceed 3 reps per set.** This keeps fatigue manageable and form consistent.
- **Prioritize form over volume.** As fatigue sets in, adjust reps to maintain proper technique.
- **Exercise selection matters.** Choose simple, safe movements that are easy to perform under fatigue.
- **Minimal rest is key.** Keep rest periods short to maximize density without compromising safety.

---

### Volume Metrics

- **Typical Reps per Exercise:** 24-36 reps over 15 minutes.
- **Total Sets:** Varies depending on how reps are distributed across the session.
- **Load Intensity:** 85-87% of 1RM for both exercises.

### Overview and Execution

Perform 8–10 reps close to failure with your initial weight. Immediately drop the weight by 10–20% and go to failure again, then drop once more by 10–20% and repeat. Rest 1–2 minutes after completing the entire drop sequence if doing multiple rounds or moving to another exercise. Once you can easily exceed 10 reps on your initial heavy set, add 2.5–5 lb next time.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you stall, try adding a brief rest-pause (e.g., 10–15 seconds) before continuing with your drop sets.
- You can also add partial reps at the end of each drop to squeeze out additional progress.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**:
    - **Bench Press**: 185×8 → drop to 165×AMRAP → drop to 145×AMRAP
    - Rest 1–2 minutes, then move on.
- **Week 2**:
    - If you got 10 reps or more on the first set, move to 190 lb for the initial set; otherwise, repeat 185 lb.
    - Continue the same drop percentages each time.

### Important Notes

- Keep rest minimal between drops so the muscles remain under stress.
- Use caution with form as the muscle fatigue accumulates rapidly during drop sets.

### Volume Metrics

Typically 3 “work segments” per sequence (1 initial set + 2 drops), repeated 1–2 times per exercise, depending on your program structure.

### Summary

The Standard Drop Set is a simple yet intense method for hypertrophy, suitable for intermediate or advanced lifters looking to extend sets past normal failure. It’s quick to implement (about 10 minutes per exercise) and works well for hitting a muscle group hard in a short timeframe.

### Overview and Execution

Perform a static hold in the most demanding range (e.g., halfway up) for 10–15 seconds. Drop the weight by 10–20% and do full-range reps to failure, then drop another 10–20% and finish with one more static hold. Rest 1–2 minutes if you repeat the sequence. Increase either the hold time (by ~5 seconds each week) or the initial load once you adapt.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If progress stalls, add partial reps after each static hold.
- You can also slightly reduce hold times if you can’t complete the dynamic reps adequately.

### Example Application

- **Week 1 (Shoulder Press)**:
    - Hold 50 lb dumbbells halfway for 10 seconds.
    - Drop to 40 lb and do reps to failure.
    - Drop to 30 lb and hold static until you can’t.
- **Week 2**:
    - Extend the first hold to 15 seconds or add 5 lb to the initial weight.

### Important Notes

Focus on proper body alignment during holds. Because you’re taxing the muscle in both static and dynamic fashions, expect a high level of fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

Each full sequence has 3 parts (static → dynamic → static). You might do 2–3 sequences total, depending on your broader program.

### Summary

Static-Dynamic Drop Sets are excellent for pushing through sticking points by combining isometric strength with dynamic reps. Suitable for intermediate to advanced lifters looking for a unique way to overload muscles.

## Overview and Execution

Thibaudeau’s 2-2-1 Wave is a high-intensity, wave-loading approach often used by Olympic lifters and advanced strength trainees who want to stimulate the nervous system and drive progress without accumulating excessive volume. Here is the general method:

- Perform **2–3 waves** of:
    
    1. **2 reps**
    2. **2 reps**
    3. **1 rep**
- Each set is typically heavier than the last, and the next wave begins slightly heavier than the _previous wave’s second set_. For example, if you ended the first wave at 90% for your single, you might begin the second wave’s first set (2 reps) at around 87.5–88% (or slightly more than the previous wave’s middle set).
    
- **Rest intervals** between sets are usually **90–120 seconds**, ensuring adequate recovery to maintain quality and avoid form breakdown.
    
- Execution for each wave:
    
    - **Wave 1**: 2 reps at ~85%, 2 at ~87.5%, 1 at ~90%
    - **Wave 2**: 2 at ~87.5%, 2 at ~90%, 1 at ~92.5% (if possible)
    - **Wave 3**: Increase again only if you’re still able to maintain proper technique and form.

Because the rep count is low (1–2), the focus is on near-maximal intensities and perfect technique. This scheme is especially popular for Olympic-style lifts (snatches, cleans, jerks) but can also be applied to squats, deadlifts, and bench press variations.

---

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Stop if you cannot add weight** without compromising form or if you miss a lift.
- If you fail to complete the prescribed rep(s) at a given weight, either **repeat the same load** for one more attempt or **end the session** to avoid excessive fatigue or risk.
- The rationale is to keep the lifts explosive and crisp. Once you grind a rep or fail entirely, the neural benefits diminish.

---

## Example Application

Below is a hypothetical example for an intermediate-to-advanced male trainee (~185 lbs, with a 1RM squat around 405 lbs) implementing Thibaudeau’s 2-2-1 wave on back squats twice a week for four weeks.

**Week 1, Day 1 (Wave 1 only)**

- Set 1 (2 reps): 345 lbs (~85%)
- Set 2 (2 reps): 355 lbs (~87.5%)
- Set 3 (1 rep): 365 lbs (~90%)

This first session might serve as a baseline, assessing how the wave feels. If form is solid and the trainee is confident, they proceed to a second wave:

- Set 4 (2 reps): 355 lbs (~87.5% again or slightly more)
- Set 5 (2 reps): 365 lbs (~90%)
- Set 6 (1 rep): 375 lbs (~92.5%)

If the trainee feels good, they can consider adding a third wave, but only if the single at 375 lbs feels strong.

**Week 1, Day 2 (Another 2–3 waves)**

- Same structure, but perhaps start Wave 1 a little heavier:
    - Set 1: 350 lbs, Set 2: 360 lbs, Set 3: 370 lbs
    - Wave 2: 360 lbs, 370 lbs, 380 lbs

**Week 2–4**

- Continue in the same pattern, adding small increments to each wave provided the lifter can maintain speed and solid mechanics (e.g., +5 lbs per set wave-to-wave).
- If at any point a set becomes too taxing, remain at that load for one more session or drop the wave volume (fewer waves) to recover.

This structure allows the lifter to harness “post-tetanic potentiation” (the concept that each heavier set “primes” the nervous system for the next) while keeping total reps relatively low.

---

## Important Notes

1. **No Training to Failure**: This method relies on speed and crisp execution. Do not grind reps.
2. **Autoregulate**: If you feel strong, push the load slightly higher in subsequent waves. If you feel off, maintain or reduce load.
3. **Stop Once You Can’t Progress**: Either end the session or skip the next wave if form or bar speed suffers.
4. **Technique Over Load**: Often used by Olympic lifters to improve technical efficiency with moderate-to-high loads.

---

## Volume Metrics

- Each wave consists of **5 total reps** (2 + 2 + 1).
- **2 waves** = 10 reps total.
- **3 waves** = 15 reps total.

Because total sets can vary (depending on whether you do 2 or 3 waves), the actual session volume remains low to moderate, emphasizing quality over quantity.

---

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s 2-2-1 Wave is an advanced wave-loading strategy ideal for lifters seeking to improve maximal strength and explosive power without accruing excessive volume. It’s particularly beneficial for Olympic lifters and experienced trainees comfortable with heavy loads. By capitalizing on short, intense sets with incremental weight increases each wave, it offers a potent neural stimulus while preserving form quality. If you’re an intermediate or advanced lifter looking for a fresh approach to break plateaus and sharpen technique, this module can be a valuable addition to your training cycle.

## Overview and Execution

**Overview**  
Thibaudeau’s 3-2-1 Wave is a lower-rep, near-max strength method emphasizing neurological adaptations (i.e., teaching your nervous system to recruit more motor units efficiently). Each “wave” consists of three sets performed in descending rep order—3, then 2, then 1—at progressively heavier loads. Once you finish Wave 1 (3–2–1), you begin Wave 2 at a slightly higher load for each corresponding rep range.

**Key Execution Points**

1. **Sets and Reps**
    
    - Perform 3 reps, then 2 reps, then 1 rep for Wave 1.
    - Increase the weight slightly for Wave 2 and repeat the 3–2–1 sequence.
    - If you still feel strong and can add weight, you can attempt Wave 3.
2. **Intensity / Loading**
    
    - Typical ranges: ~85% for the first 3 reps, then ~87.5% for 2 reps, ~90% for 1 rep in Wave 1.
    - Each wave gets progressively heavier (e.g., Wave 2 might be ~87.5% for 3 reps, ~90% for 2 reps, ~92.5% for 1 rep).
3. **Rest Intervals**
    
    - Generally 90–120 seconds between sets.
    - Extend rest to 2–3 minutes if necessary, especially for heavier single-rep sets.
4. **Progression**
    
    - Autoregulate: continue adding waves only if you can maintain form and hit the prescribed reps with heavier weight.
    - Once performance drops or technique fails, conclude the wave session.

---

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail to complete the prescribed reps or cannot increase the load wave-to-wave, it’s a sign to stop adding waves.
- Consider slightly increasing rest periods, reviewing technique, or reducing the load jump if you repeatedly stall.
- If stalling persists, reduce overall intensity for a session or switch to a different training protocol to allow for recovery.

## Example Application

Below is a simple example for an intermediate 185 lbs (~84 kg) male lifter aiming to peak strength in the back squat. Percentages are estimates based on a 1RM of ~365 lbs (165.5 kg). Adjust as needed for your actual 1RM.

**Wave 1**

- Set 1 (3 reps): 310 lbs (~85%)
- Set 2 (2 reps): 320 lbs (~87.5%)
- Set 3 (1 rep): 330 lbs (~90%)

**Wave 2**

- Set 4 (3 reps): 320 lbs (~87.5%)
- Set 5 (2 reps): 330 lbs (~90%)
- Set 6 (1 rep): 340 lbs (~92.5%)

If you still feel strong and want to attempt Wave 3, you might do:

- Set 7 (3 reps): 325 lbs (~89%)
- Set 8 (2 reps): 335 lbs (~91.5%)
- Set 9 (1 rep): 345 lbs (~94%)

**Weekly Structure**

- Perform this 3-2-1 wave approach once or twice per week for the squat (or other main lift) within a training program that includes accessory work on other days.
- On subsequent weeks, you may try starting each wave slightly heavier (e.g., +5 lbs to each set). Continue only as long as technique remains solid and you can hit the prescribed reps.

---

## Important Notes

- **Avoid Training to Failure**: Keep the bar speed reasonably fast, especially on the single rep, to reinforce neural efficiency.
- **Short, Intense Peaking**: Best used in a brief cycle (2–3 weeks) when you want to sharpen maximal strength.
- **Autoregulation is Key**: If your performance drops, end the waves to prevent excessive strain.

---

## Volume Metrics

- Each wave includes 3 + 2 + 1 = **6 reps total**.
- Typically, 2–3 waves per session = **12–18 total reps** at high intensity.

---

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s 3-2-1 Wave is a specialized method for rapid strength gains, leveraging neurological factors through near-maximal loading and wave progression. It’s best suited for intermediate to advanced lifters who want to push their 1RM higher over a short peaking phase. By adding small increments with each new wave, you “trick” the nervous system into progressively handling heavier loads. Proper rest, solid technique, and strategic wave increases are essential to maximize benefits and minimize risks.

## Overview and Execution

Thibaudeau’s 5-3-1 Wave is a strength-focused loading strategy that uses **2–3 waves** of descending repetitions (5, 3, and 1). Each wave increases the load for each set, and subsequent waves start with a heavier load than the previous wave did for the same rep count. Key points:

- **Waves**:  
  - **Wave 1**: 5 reps → 3 reps → 1 rep  
  - **Wave 2**: 5 reps (heavier than Wave 1’s 5-rep load) → 3 reps (heavier) → 1 rep (heavier)  
  - **Wave 3 (optional)**: If you still feel strong and maintain form, repeat the same 5-3-1 pattern at slightly heavier loads.
- **Load Ranges**: Typically **80–95% of 1RM**, but adjust according to performance.
- **Rest Intervals**: Approximately **2 minutes** between sets; increase if needed for heavier singles.
- **Progression**: Each wave should challenge you more than the last, but avoid grinding or incomplete reps.

This approach is somewhat “auto-regulated” since you can decide mid-workout if an additional wave is feasible without sacrificing form or speed.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

While this module does not specifically detail extensive plateau-busting methods, here are general recommendations:

- **Reduce the Number of Waves**: If performance declines, stick to 2 total waves or even just 1 wave in a session.
- **Reset Loads**: If you fail to hit your target reps or feel consistently unable to complete the wave, reduce your training weights by 5–10% and build back up.
- **Technique Check**: Ensure proper form and bar speed—stalling might be linked to technical breakdown rather than pure strength limitation.

## Example Application

Below is a practical example of two waves for an intermediate to advanced trainee (~185 lbs) aiming for a 1RM around 365 lbs in a given lift (e.g., back squat).

Wave 1: 5 reps at 85%, 3 reps at 90%, 1 rep at 92.5% Wave 2: 5 reps at 87.5%, 3 reps at 92.5%, 1 rep at 95%

To put this into real numbers (approximate):
- **1RM Assumption**: 365 lbs
- **85%** ≈ 310 lbs
- **87.5%** ≈ 320 lbs
- **90%** ≈ 330 lbs
- **92.5%** ≈ 340 lbs
- **95%** ≈ 350 lbs

**Session Flow** (after thorough warm-up):  
- **Wave 1**:  
  1. **5 reps** @ 310 lbs  
  2. **3 reps** @ 330 lbs  
  3. **1 rep** @ 340 lbs  
- **Wave 2**:  
  4. **5 reps** @ 320 lbs  
  5. **3 reps** @ 340 lbs  
  6. **1 rep** @ 350 lbs  

If you feel strong and have solid bar speed, you might add a **Wave 3**, jumping each load by ~5–10 lbs from Wave 2’s corresponding set.

### Multi-Session Progression Example (Over Several Weeks)

Assume you repeat this 2-wave setup once weekly:

- **Week 1**:  
  - Wave 1 loads: (85%, 90%, 92.5%)  
  - Wave 2 loads: (87.5%, 92.5%, 95%)  
- **Week 2**:  
  - Increase each set by 5 lbs from previous week’s corresponding sets if all reps were completed with good form.  
- **Week 3**:  
  - Continue adding small load increments if performance remains strong.  
- **Week 4**:  
  - If bar speed slows or form deteriorates, consider a lighter “Wave 1” or reduce to 2 total sets per wave (e.g., 5-rep, 1-rep, skipping the 3-rep set).

## Important Notes

- **Effective for building strength with moderate volume.**  
- **Avoid grinding failures**—stop a wave early if form or speed suffers.  
- **Adjust the number of waves** based on daily performance and recovery status.

## Volume Metrics

- Each wave = **5 + 3 + 1 = 9 reps**  
- Two waves = **18 reps**  
- Three waves = **27 reps**  

Though the volume (total reps) is relatively low, the intensity is high, and the repeated exposure to heavy loads can be very effective for neurological adaptations.

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s 5-3-1 Wave module is ideal for intermediate to advanced trainees seeking a potent strength stimulus. By cycling through progressively heavier 5-rep, 3-rep, and 1-rep sets, you challenge the body both in terms of volume (moderate) and intensity (high). The approach remains auto-regulated, letting you add or remove waves based on daily readiness. This makes it a versatile, time-efficient strategy for driving steady strength gains without excessive risk of burnout.

### Overview and Execution

> Use two waves per main exercise. Each wave has sets of 6, 4, and 2 reps, increasing the load each set. The second wave starts heavier than the first.

**Additional Explanation**

- This module employs “wave loading,” where each set in a wave is heavier than the previous.
- You perform 6 reps, then 4 reps, then 2 reps—each at an increased load.
- After completing the first 3 sets (Wave 1), you begin Wave 2 with a slightly heavier load than what you used for the same rep count in Wave 1.

**Typical Rest Intervals**

- Rest 2 to 3 minutes between sets (or as needed to maintain performance).
- Due to the heavier nature of the loads, adequate rest is crucial.

---

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

There is no specific stalling or plateau guidance provided in the JSON. Common practice is to reduce load increases or maintain load across waves if you fail to hit the target reps. If repeated plateaus occur, consider reducing overall volume or adding a light deload week.

---

### Example Application

> Wave 1: 6 reps at ~70%, 4 reps at ~80%, 2 reps at ~85%.  
> Wave 2: 6 reps at ~75%, 4 reps at ~85%, 2 reps at ~90%.

**Real-World Illustration (Squat Example for a 185 lb Intermediate)**  
Let’s assume a 1RM of ~315 lbs on the back squat.

- **Wave 1**
    
    - Set 1 (6 reps): 70% ≈ 220 lbs
    - Set 2 (4 reps): 80% ≈ 250 lbs
    - Set 3 (2 reps): 85% ≈ 270 lbs
- **Wave 2**
    
    - Set 4 (6 reps): 75% ≈ 235 lbs
    - Set 5 (4 reps): 85% ≈ 270 lbs
    - Set 6 (2 reps): 90% ≈ 285 lbs

**Progression Over Sessions**

- **Session 1**: Perform the above waves successfully.
- **Session 2**: Slightly increase each wave’s loading (e.g., +5 lbs for 6-rep sets, +5–10 lbs for 4-rep and 2-rep sets).
- **Session 3 & Onward**: Continue adding small increments if you hit all prescribed reps. If you fail, repeat or slightly reduce the increment the following session.

---

### Important Notes

> Focus on building both size and strength. Keep the number of waves to about two due to fatigue.

- Do not push beyond two waves if performance deteriorates.
- Keep form strict and avoid training to absolute failure.
- Autoregulate loading if needed: if you’re fatigued, reduce the planned increases or keep the same weight from the first wave in the second wave.

---

### Volume Metrics

> 2 waves x (6+4+2) = 24 total reps per exercise

By design, each exercise gets a total of 24 reps (6 sets × 4 average reps = 24). This keeps session volume moderate while still exposing you to heavy loads.

---

### Summary

Thibaudeau’s 6-4-2 Wave targets a balance of hypertrophy and strength, skewing heavier than higher-rep protocols. Ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters looking to push heavier weights but still accumulate enough volume for muscle growth. By gradually increasing loads across two consecutive waves, the lifter receives a potent stimulus without excessive volume or time commitment.

## Overview and Execution

This module uses a wave loading approach that blends strength and hypertrophy. Each “wave” involves three sets: 7 reps, then 5 reps, then 3 reps, with the load increasing as reps decrease. After completing the first wave (7-5-3), you optionally begin the second wave with a slightly heavier load than your first wave.

  - 7 reps at a moderately light load (e.g., ~75% 1RM)  
  - 5 reps at a heavier load (~80% 1RM)  
  - 3 reps at an even heavier load (~85% 1RM)

- **Wave 2**  
  - 7 reps, slightly heavier than your first 7-rep set (e.g., ~80% 1RM)  
  - 5 reps, slightly heavier than your first 5-rep set (~85% 1RM)  
  - 3 reps, slightly heavier than your first 3-rep set (~90% 1RM)

> **Rest Intervals**: Aim for about 90–180 seconds between sets, allowing enough recovery to maintain performance while also harnessing post-tetanic potentiation.

Limit yourself to **two waves**. Past that point, fatigue generally outweighs the benefits and can diminish performance.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

*(No explicit stalling strategies were provided in the JSON or source. If you do encounter missed reps or stalls, consider slightly reducing loads in subsequent waves or adding a brief deload week before retrying.)*

---

## Example Application

Below is a simple outline of how an intermediate 185 lb male trainee might run this program on a main exercise (e.g., Barbell Back Squat) twice per week for three weeks:

**Week 1 (Day 1):**  
- Wave 1: 
  - 7 reps @ ~75% of 1RM  
  - 5 reps @ ~80% of 1RM  
  - 3 reps @ ~85% of 1RM  
- Wave 2: 
  - 7 reps @ ~80% of 1RM  
  - 5 reps @ ~85% of 1RM  
  - 3 reps @ ~90% of 1RM  

**Week 1 (Day 2):**  
- Wave 1: 
  - 7 reps @ ~76% (slight increase from Day 1)  
  - 5 reps @ ~81%  
  - 3 reps @ ~86%  
- Wave 2: 
  - 7 reps @ ~81%  
  - 5 reps @ ~86%  
  - 3 reps @ ~91%  

Each week, you might increase each percentage by 1–2% if the previous sessions were successful and felt manageable. This progression continues over several weeks, or until you reach a peak intensity or experience diminished performance.

---

## Important Notes

- **Limit to Two Waves**: Going beyond two waves often leads to excessive fatigue with minimal additional benefit.  
- **Conservative Starts**: Begin Wave 1 with a load you know you can manage for the prescribed reps.  
- **Avoid Training to Failure**: Stopping just shy of failure helps maintain better performance in subsequent sets.  
- **Autoregulate**: If performance drops drastically, reduce load slightly or extend rest.  

---

## Volume Metrics

**2 waves × (7 + 5 + 3) = 30 total reps per exercise**.  
- For a single movement (e.g., squat), expect around 30 reps.  
- Adjust the number of exercises and accessories based on your overall program volume needs.

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s 7-5-3 Wave module is a **wave loading** protocol designed to develop both size and strength. By starting with moderate loads for higher reps (7) and progressing to heavier loads for lower reps (3), it targets multiple aspects of muscular development. This approach is best suited for **intermediate to advanced lifters** who can handle relatively heavy loads while maintaining proper technique. Keep waves limited to two to avoid excessive fatigue, and autoregulate as needed to ensure continued progress.

## Overview and Execution

A “block” approach to wave loading means sticking with one wave scheme (e.g., 7-5-3, 5-3-1, 3-2-1) for several consecutive weeks before moving to a new scheme. This creates focused progression blocks where you can adapt to one pattern before shifting to another.

- **Block 1 (Weeks 1–4)**  
  - Wave scheme: 7-5-3  
  - Perform 2 (or more) “waves” per main exercise.  
  - Start with slightly conservative weights, then increase each wave (e.g., if your first wave uses 70% on the 7-rep set, 75% on the 5-rep, and 80% on the 3-rep, your second wave might use 72–73% → 77–78% → 82–83%).

- **Block 2 (Weeks 5–8)**  
  - Wave scheme: 5-3-1  
  - Aim for 2–3 waves per main exercise.  
  - Increase the load each wave in a similar fashion (e.g., if you start wave 1 with 80% for 5 reps, wave 2 might be ~82% for 5 reps).

- **Block 3 (Weeks 9–11)**  
  - Wave scheme: 3-2-1  
  - Perform 2–3 waves per main exercise.  
  - Loads are now near-maximal. Start each week slightly lower (90–92%) and work up to heavier sets (~95+%).

**Rest Intervals**: Typically 90–180 seconds between sets. Adjust as reps get lower and loads get heavier—some may prefer up to 3 minutes for the lower-rep waves.

**Progression**: 
1. Start each block conservatively for the first week to allow room for progressive overload.  
2. Aim to add small weight increments session-to-session or wave-to-wave within each block.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

*(No direct stalling strategies are specified in the JSON or source. You may consider introducing a lighter session or small weight reset if you fail prescribed reps.)*

---

## Example Application

**Scenario**: An advanced 185-lb male lifter with a roughly 315-lb 1RM bench press, 405-lb 1RM squat, and 455-lb 1RM deadlift.

- **Weeks 1–4 (7-5-3)**  
  - **Squat**: Wave 1 at ~65–70% for 7 reps, 75% for 5 reps, 80% for 3 reps. Wave 2 slightly heavier (e.g., +5–10 lbs).  
  - **Bench**: Similar structure, starting at ~67–70% for 7 reps, ~75% for 5 reps, ~80–82% for 3 reps, then add small increments for Wave 2.  
  - **Deadlift**: Possibly keep volume lower (1–2 waves) due to the taxing nature of deadlifts.

- **Weeks 5–8 (5-3-1)**  
  - **Squat**: Wave 1 at ~75% for 5 reps, ~82% for 3 reps, ~88% for 1 rep. Wave 2 at ~77–78% → ~84–85% → ~90–92%.  
  - **Bench**: Start around ~77% for 5 reps, ~84% for 3 reps, ~90% for 1 rep; progress similarly each wave.  
  - **Deadlift**: 2 waves, starting around ~75–80% → ~85% → ~90+% for the triple and single.

- **Weeks 9–11 (3-2-1)**  
  - **Squat**: Wave 1 might be 85%×3, 90%×2, 92–93%×1; Wave 2 or 3 might push up to 95+% on the single.  
  - **Bench**: Similar approach, starting with ~87–88% for 3 reps, ~92% for 2 reps, ~95% for 1 rep, and attempting heavier loads in subsequent waves.  
  - **Deadlift**: Typically 1–2 waves. Consider up to 95+% by the final single.

---

## Important Notes

- **Progression of Reps**: Transition from higher-rep waves (size/hypertrophy focus) to moderate- and then low-rep waves (strength focus).  
- **No Training to Failure**: Each set should end with at least 1 rep “in reserve.”  
- **Autoregulated**: Adjust loads if you feel fatigue is accumulating too quickly or if you miss reps.  
- **Block Duration**: Blocks typically last 3–4 weeks to allow adaptation.  
- **Final Phase**: The 3-2-1 waves are near-maximal, so pay close attention to recovery and technique.

---

## Volume Metrics

- **Varies by block; wave structure changes each phase.**  
- As a rough guideline, each wave consists of 3 sets (for example, 7-5-3). If performing 2 waves, that’s 6 total sets per exercise per session in that block. The exact total depends on how many waves you perform and which exercises you include.

---

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s Wave Loading Block Approach is an 11-week program divided into three distinct wave-loading phases. Each block focuses on a particular rep scheme—progressing from moderate-to-high reps (7-5-3) to moderate-to-low reps (5-3-1) and finally culminating in near-maximal loads (3-2-1). This structured progression allows lifters to gradually build hypertrophy and improve strength over multiple waves before transitioning into heavier intensities. It’s well-suited for intermediate and advanced trainees looking for a clear, methodical progression plan with built-in variety and autoregulation.

## Overview and Execution

**Concept**  
The Pendulum Wave Approach “swings” through different rep schemes from week to week (e.g., 7-5-3, then 5-3-1, then 3-2-1, etc.). This frequent variation helps stimulate strength and hypertrophy by preventing the body from over-adapting to a single rep range.

**Execution Basics**

- Each “wave” (e.g., 7-5-3) usually involves three working sets performed in ascending weight order. For instance:
    - Set 1: 7 reps (moderate load)
    - Set 2: 5 reps (heavier load)
    - Set 3: 3 reps (heaviest load)
- In the following week, you switch to a different wave scheme (e.g., 5-3-1).
- Keep rest intervals between 90–180 seconds, adjusting based on how you recover.
- Strive to add weight each set while still maintaining good form and an RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) that doesn’t lead to frequent failures.

**Rationale**

- By consistently altering the rep range, you’ll challenge different muscle fiber types and energy systems.
- This can be especially beneficial for intermediate to advanced lifters who find that sticking to one rep range for too long leads to stagnation or boredom.
- Tracking loads for each scheme from cycle to cycle is essential for progressive overload.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

Although this protocol is designed to reduce staleness via weekly variation, you might still encounter plateaus. Some potential strategies include:

- **Adjust Your Starting Loads**: If you stall mid-wave, reduce the load for the next session so you can complete the prescribed reps.
- **Add a Deload Week**: Even though this module doesn’t explicitly schedule a deload, you can introduce a lighter, lower-volume week if you feel excessively fatigued.
- **Focus on Technique**: Video your lifts to ensure technical proficiency, as poor form can contribute to stalled progress.

---

## Example Application

Below is a hypothetical 6-week layout for a 185 lb intermediate-to-advanced male lifter. Assume this is for the squat, though you can apply the same logic to other main lifts (bench, deadlift, etc.). The first number in each wave represents the highest rep target (lighter set) and the final number is the lowest rep target (heaviest set).

**Week 1 (7-5-3)**

- Set 1: 7 reps @ ~225 lbs
- Set 2: 5 reps @ ~245 lbs
- Set 3: 3 reps @ ~265 lbs
- (Increase or maintain loads over subsequent sessions if you feel strong, ensuring you hit all prescribed reps.)

**Week 2 (5-3-1)**

- Set 1: 5 reps @ ~235 lbs
- Set 2: 3 reps @ ~255 lbs
- Set 3: 1 rep @ ~275–285 lbs

**Week 3 (3-2-1)**

- Set 1: 3 reps @ ~245 lbs
- Set 2: 2 reps @ ~265 lbs
- Set 3: 1 rep @ ~285–295 lbs

**Week 4 (6-4-2)**

- Set 1: 6 reps @ ~235 lbs
- Set 2: 4 reps @ ~255 lbs
- Set 3: 2 reps @ ~275 lbs

**Week 5 (3-2-1)**

- Repeat the same structure as Week 3, but aim to add 5–10 lbs if able.

**Week 6 (2-2-1)**

- Set 1: 2 reps @ ~275 lbs
- Set 2: 2 reps @ ~285 lbs
- Set 3: 1 rep @ ~300+ lbs (if strong enough)

_Note:_ The loads above are examples and should be adjusted to the individual’s capacity and progress.

## Important Notes

- **Frequent Variation Avoids Plateaus**: Changing rep schemes weekly provides fresh stimuli for both neuromuscular adaptation and hypertrophy.
- **Progress Conservatively**: Each weekly wave is performed similarly—start with a manageable weight and increase each set if you’re hitting the target reps.
- **Autoregulation**: If a certain day feels off, reduce load slightly or repeat the previous week’s weights instead of forcing progression.

---

## Volume Metrics

- **“Varies Each Week”**: Because each wave scheme involves different rep counts, weekly volume will fluctuate.
- You can calculate total volume per workout by summing `(sets × reps × load)`. Track this over time to see how changes in rep schemes influence overall volume.

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s Pendulum Wave Approach is a 6-week rotating wave scheme that provides variety in rep ranges each week. This method particularly benefits intermediate to advanced trainees who grow stale with a single rep range or plateau frequently. By “swinging” rep targets (7-5-3 one week, 5-3-1 the next, etc.), the lifter hits multiple strength and hypertrophy stimuli, maintains engagement, and can push for progressive overload across each wave.

If you value frequent changes in set/rep prescriptions and want to avoid stagnation, this approach may be an excellent fit.

### Overview and Execution

Start a timer for 10 minutes. At the top of each minute, perform **1 rep** at about **90% of your 1RM**. Rest for whatever remains of that minute. Because the reps are heavy singles, keep technique and bar speed in check. If you can’t maintain solid form, reduce the load accordingly. Progress by adding a small amount of weight (2.5–5 lb) once you can consistently hit all 10 singles.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail a rep or feel the weight is too heavy to sustain form for all 10 sets, reduce the load by 5–10% at the next session.
- You may also drop the total sets to 8 if 10 is too demanding, then work back to 10 once form is consistent.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 10 x 1 at 200 lb for all sets.
- If successful with no form breakdown, add 5 lb next session.
- **Week 2**: 10 x 1 at 205 lb. If the final rep slows or form deteriorates, repeat 205 lb in the next session before increasing again.

### Important Notes

- Maintain strict form: a single heavy rep can place a lot of stress on the body if performed poorly.
- Keep rest times consistent: each new set starts exactly at the top of the next minute.

### Volume Metrics

- **Total volume**: 10 sets × 1 rep = 10 reps per session.

### Summary

This module suits intermediate or advanced trainees looking to build maximal strength through repeated heavy singles while keeping fatigue manageable. It’s simple, time-efficient, and effective for honing technique under near-maximal loads.

## Overview and Execution

The Three Storm Triple Pyramid builds endurance, strength, and muscular stamina through progressive repetition schemes. Select three exercises based on your fitness goals. Use rep multipliers (x1, x2, x3) to adjust the difficulty, ensuring a balanced workout. Begin with a 1-6-1 pyramid and gradually increase to 1-10-1 as your capacity improves.

Ensure the exercises complement each other: for instance, pairing pushing and pulling movements with a lower-body or core-focused exercise. An example could be:
- **Pulling Movement (x1)**: Pullups, Rows, or Ring Pullups.
- **Pushing Movement (x2)**: Pushups, Dips, or Bench Press.
- **Lower/Full-body/Core Movement (x3)**: Situps, Kettlebell Swings, or Squats.

Rest minimally between exercises, but adjust as needed for fatigue and form integrity.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you struggle to reach your intended peak (e.g., step 8), finish the workout with as many reps as possible. Track your total reps and aim to beat them in subsequent sessions. If progress stalls over multiple workouts, reduce the intensity, swap exercises, or lower the pyramid's peak before gradually increasing volume again.

## Example Application

An intermediate 185 lbs trainee selects:
- **Ring Pullups (x1)**
- **Ring Dips (x2)**
- **Kettlebell Swings (x3)**

**Week 1:** Start with a 1-6-1 pyramid.
- Step 1: 1 Pullup, 2 Dips, 3 Swings
- Step 2: 2 Pullups, 4 Dips, 6 Swings
- Step 3: 3 Pullups, 6 Dips, 9 Swings
- Step 4: 4 Pullups, 8 Dips, 12 Swings
- Step 5: 5 Pullups, 10 Dips, 15 Swings
- Step 6: 6 Pullups, 12 Dips, 18 Swings
- Then descend back to Step 1.

**Progression:** Add one more step in subsequent weeks until reaching a 1-10-1 pyramid.

## Important Notes

- Select exercises based on your fitness level and equipment availability.
- Adjust multipliers to avoid overtraining or underloading.
- Avoid combining core-heavy exercises with spine-loaded movements to maintain proper form.
- Progressively increase pyramid peaks while monitoring for fatigue and plateaus.

## Volume Metrics

- **1x exercises:** 36-100 reps
- **2x exercises:** 72-200 reps
- **3x exercises:** 108-300 reps

These metrics depend on the number of steps completed in the pyramid.

## Summary

The Three Storm Triple Pyramid is a flexible, endurance-building workout adaptable to all fitness levels. Its progression structure fosters consistent strength gains while accommodating various movement combinations to target multiple muscle groups. Ideal for those looking to improve muscular stamina and overall conditioning through scalable, autoregulated training.

### Overview and Execution

Use a set time interval (30 seconds) instead of a rep count. Start with a challenging load for the first 30-second set, then immediately drop weight by 10–20% for another 30 seconds, then drop again for a final 30-second set. Rest 1–2 minutes if doing multiple rounds. Increase either the total time per set (e.g., 35 seconds) or the starting load once you can sustain a solid rep tempo across all intervals.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If rep speed or form degrades, try slightly decreasing the initial load.
- You could also add a fourth 30-second interval if you want more volume and the source suggests extra drops when progress stalls.

### Example Application

For a leg press:

- **Week 1**: 200 lb for 30s → drop to 180 lb for 30s → drop to 160 lb for 30s. Rest 1–2 min.
- **Week 2**: If you maintained consistent reps throughout, add 10 lb to the initial load or increase each interval to 35 seconds.

### Important Notes

Machine-based exercises are preferred for quick load changes. Maintain steady form and consistent tempo—avoid sloppy reps as you fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

You’ll complete 3 time-based segments (each 30 seconds). Usually repeated 2–3 times for a total of 6–9 intervals of work.

### Summary

Time-Based Drop Sets focus on continuous time under tension, helping build muscular endurance and hypertrophy. This is an excellent option for lifters wanting a clear, timed framework instead of rigid rep counts.

## Overview and Execution

VBT bases training on bar speed rather than a percentage of 1RM or RPE. You set a velocity threshold for the given goal (e.g., 0.6 m/s for strength-focus). Perform 3–5 reps per set and monitor each rep’s speed:

- **Stop** the set when the speed dips below the threshold.
- **Progress** the load if you maintain or exceed the target velocity in all reps across all sets.
- **Deload** or reduce load if velocity consistently falls short.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Adjust Velocity Threshold**: If you stall, either lower the threshold temporarily to work on strength, or raise it to emphasize power.
- **Lighter Speed Sessions**: Use periods of lower load/higher bar speed to recover while honing technique.

## Example Application

For an intermediate 185 lb lifter with a ~400 lb squat 1RM:

- **Goal**: Work in a zone around 0.6 m/s. Start at ~70% (280 lb).
- Perform sets of 3 reps, monitoring velocity each rep. If any rep drops below 0.6 m/s, end that set.
- If all sets stay above 0.6 m/s, add 5–10 lb next session.

## Important Notes

- Need a velocity device (e.g., Tendo unit, GymAware, or smartphone app).
- Emphasizes technique consistency because bar path influences velocity readings.

## Volume Metrics

Commonly 4–6 sets of 3–5 reps, though total volume depends on how quickly velocity drops in each set.

## Summary

Velocity-Based Training introduces precise autoregulation by measuring bar speed. It’s particularly popular in athletic settings where power development is critical. Good for intermediate/advanced lifters who have the tools to measure velocity and want to optimize training load in real time.

### Overview and Execution

The 5/3/1 program is a four-week cycle designed to build strength progressively:

- **Week 1**: 65% x 5, 75% x 5, 85% x 5+  
- **Week 2**: 70% x 3, 80% x 3, 90% x 3+  
- **Week 3**: 75% x 5, 85% x 3, 95% x 1+  
- **Week 4 (Deload)**: 40-60% x 5 for all sets

Percentages are based on 90% of your true 1RM (the “training max”). The final “+ set” in Weeks 1–3 is performed for as many clean, solid reps as possible—stop when your form begins to break. Rest 3–5 minutes between heavier sets and 1–2 minutes for lighter/deload sets. At the end of Week 4, increase your training max by 5 lbs for upper-body lifts (bench, overhead press) and 10 lbs for lower-body lifts (squat, deadlift). Then begin the next four-week cycle.

---

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

Although plateaus aren’t explicitly detailed in this module, the program emphasizes **accurate training maxes** and **small weight jumps** after each cycle. If you stall (i.e., fail to meet rep goals for multiple sessions), consider:
- Resetting or lowering your training max by ~10%.
- Ensuring adequate recovery and nutrition.
- Checking form, technique, and accessory work.

---

### Example Application

Using an intermediate ~185 lbs male lifter with a 300 lbs squat 1RM:

1. **Training Max**: 90% of 300 = 270 lbs.  
2. **Week 1 (5s)**:  
   - 65% x 5 = 175 lbs  
   - 75% x 5 = 205 lbs  
   - 85% x 5+ = 230 lbs (AMRAP)  
3. **Week 2 (3s)**:  
   - 70% x 3 = 190 lbs  
   - 80% x 3 = 215 lbs  
   - 90% x 3+ = 245 lbs (AMRAP)  
4. **Week 3 (5/3/1)**:  
   - 75% x 5 = 205 lbs  
   - 85% x 3 = 230 lbs  
   - 95% x 1+ = 255 lbs (AMRAP)  
5. **Week 4 (Deload)**:  
   - 40–60% x 5 each set, e.g., 120–160 lbs  

After Week 4, increase squat training max by 10 lbs (to 280 lbs) and repeat.

---

### Important Notes

- **Start with 90% of your 1RM** to avoid stalling too soon.  
- **Perform the final set** each week for maximum quality reps without sacrificing technique.  
- **Add 5 lbs** to upper-body lifts (bench, overhead press) and **10 lbs** to lower-body lifts (squat, deadlift) after each cycle.  
- **Don’t skip the deload**: it’s crucial for recovery and consistent progress over time.

---

### Volume Metrics

In a typical week (excluding warm-ups and assistance work):  
- **Week 1**: 3 working sets of (5,5,5+)  
- **Week 2**: 3 working sets of (3,3,3+)  
- **Week 3**: 3 working sets of (5,3,1+)  
- **Week 4**: 3 working sets of 5 (deload)  

The plus sets often increase the total rep count depending on individual performance.

---

### Summary

Wendler’s 5/3/1 program is a tried-and-true method for steady strength gains. Its moderate starting point (90% of 1RM) and small incremental weight increases help lifters avoid plateaus while still pushing for rep records in the final “+ set.” The built-in deload promotes adequate recovery and longevity. This module suits lifters from late-beginner to advanced who want a straightforward framework that balances progression, stability, and long-term training success.

## Overview and Execution

### Standard 5/3/1 Breakdown
The 5/3/1 program is a four-week cycle designed to drive long-term strength gains. It uses a “Training Max” (TM) of about 90% of your real or estimated 1RM. Each week focuses on different percentage ranges:

- **Week 1 (5s Week)**  
  - Set 1: 65% x 5  
  - Set 2: 75% x 5  
  - Set 3: 85% x 5+ (AMRAP)

- **Week 2 (3s Week)**  
  - Set 1: 70% x 3  
  - Set 2: 80% x 3  
  - Set 3: 90% x 3+ (AMRAP)

- **Week 3 (5/3/1 Week)**  
  - Set 1: 75% x 5  
  - Set 2: 85% x 3  
  - Set 3: 95% x 1+ (AMRAP)

- **Week 4 (Deload)**  
  - Set 1: 40% x 5  
  - Set 2: 50% x 5  
  - Set 3: 60% x 5  

After the deload week, add 5 lb to upper-body TMs (press, bench) and 10 lb to lower-body TMs (squat, deadlift). This progression repeats every cycle.

### Adding Joker Sets
After finishing each week’s main work (including the AMRAP set), you can perform “Joker Sets” if you feel strong and sufficiently recovered. Simply increase the load by 5–10% for each additional set while keeping the day’s rep count (5s, 3s, or 1s). Continue as long as technique stays solid.

**Key Points**:
- Joker Sets are optional; skip them if the AMRAP set leaves you too fatigued.  
- They do not alter your Training Max for future cycles—simply an autoregulatory way to lift heavier when conditions allow.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies
If you begin missing reps on the main sets or consistently feel too fatigued for AMRAP sets:
- Reduce your Training Max by 5–10% and rebuild momentum.  
- Make sure you aren’t skipping the Week 4 deload.  
- Evaluate nutrition, recovery, and stress levels, as 5/3/1 demands consistent progression over time.

## Example Application

**Intermediate 185 lb Male Lifter** with a 300 lb squat Training Max:

- **Week 1 (5s)**  
  - 65% (195 lb) x 5  
  - 75% (225 lb) x 5  
  - 85% (255 lb) x 5+ (AMRAP)  
  - Optional Joker Sets (if strong):  
    - 90% (270 lb) x 5  
    - 95% (285 lb) x 5

- **Week 2 (3s)**  
  - 70% (210 lb) x 3  
  - 80% (240 lb) x 3  
  - 90% (270 lb) x 3+  
  - Optional Joker Sets:  
    - 95% (285 lb) x 3  
    - 100% (300 lb) x 3

- **Week 3 (5/3/1)**  
  - 75% (225 lb) x 5  
  - 85% (255 lb) x 3  
  - 95% (285 lb) x 1+  
  - Optional Joker Sets:  
    - 100% (300 lb) x 1  
    - 105% (315 lb) x 1

- **Week 4 (Deload)**  
  - 40% (120 lb) x 5  
  - 50% (150 lb) x 5  
  - 60% (180 lb) x 5  

After completing Week 4, add 10 lb to this lifter’s squat TM (now 310 lb) and repeat.

## Important Notes

- **Perform Joker Sets only on days you feel strong.**  
- If technique degrades or you fail a Joker Set, discontinue them.  
- Stick to the standard 5 lb (upper) / 10 lb (lower) increments at the start of each new cycle, regardless of Joker Set performance.  
- Always deload every fourth week to mitigate fatigue and ensure steady long-term progress.

## Volume Metrics

- **Main 5/3/1**: 3 sets per workout (each with final AMRAP).  
- **Joker Sets**: 0–3+ additional sets at increased loads.  
- Overall volume can vary significantly based on how many extra Joker Sets you perform.

## Summary

Wendler’s 5/3/1 with Joker Sets offers a structured four-week cycle for building strength in the squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press. The foundation is the standard 5/3/1 progression, which steadily increases your Training Max by small amounts each cycle. Joker Sets provide an autoregulatory bonus on strong days, allowing you to push heavier while still maintaining Wendler’s straightforward, progression-focused framework. It’s best suited for intermediate to advanced lifters who can accurately gauge their readiness and manage fatigue over multiple cycles.

## Overview and Execution

The **Boring But Big (BBB)** loading module is a high-volume training approach designed to build hypertrophy and reinforce movement patterns through increased total workload. While commonly used within **Jim Wendler’s 5/3/1 system**, it can also function independently as a **supplemental volume block** in a strength training program.

### **How It Works**
1. **Main Lift:** Perform a **primary strength movement** (e.g., squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead press) using a separate set/rep scheme, often a heavy protocol like 3x5 or 5x3.
2. **Supplemental Volume:** After completing the main lift, perform **5 sets of 10 reps** at **50-60% of 1RM** for the same exercise or a variation.
3. **Rest Periods:**
   - **Between Main Lift Sets:** **3-4 minutes** (heavier loads require longer recovery).
   - **Between Supplemental Sets:** **90-120 seconds** (shorter rest to maintain hypertrophy focus).

This method prioritizes **high total volume** over maximal intensity, creating a **muscular endurance and hypertrophy effect** while reinforcing movement mechanics under moderate loads.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If progression stalls or recovery becomes an issue:
- **Reduce Supplemental Volume Temporarily**: Drop to **4x10** instead of 5x10, or reduce intensity to 45-50% of 1RM.
- **Cycle Load Progression**: If weight increases cause performance breakdown, revert to a lighter percentage and build back up.
- **Exercise Variation**: Instead of repeating the exact main lift, try **close variations** (e.g., Romanian Deadlifts instead of conventional deadlifts).

## Example Application

**Scenario:** An intermediate lifter (185 lbs, 1RM Bench = 250 lbs) follows **BBB** for bench press.

**Week 1:**
- **Main Lift:** Bench Press 3x5 at **80% 1RM (200 lbs)**
- **Supplemental:** Bench Press 5x10 at **50% 1RM (125 lbs)**

**Week 2:**
- **Main Lift:** Bench Press 3x5 at **82.5% 1RM (205 lbs)**
- **Supplemental:** Bench Press 5x10 at **55% 1RM (135 lbs)**

**Week 3:**
- **Main Lift:** Bench Press 3x5 at **85% 1RM (212 lbs)**
- **Supplemental:** Bench Press 5x10 at **60% 1RM (150 lbs)**

**Week 4 (Deload or Reset)**:
- **Main Lift:** Bench Press 3x5 at **70% 1RM (175 lbs)**
- **Supplemental:** Bench Press 5x10 at **50% 1RM (125 lbs)**

After 4-6 weeks, reassess 1RM and restart the cycle at a slightly higher weight.

## Important Notes

- **Track Recovery:** High volume can be fatiguing. If soreness is excessive, adjust weight, volume, or frequency.
- **Form Consistency is Key:** Repeating the same movement under **moderate loads** helps reinforce technique.
- **Exercise Variability:** Substitute the supplemental lift with **similar movements** (e.g., front squat instead of back squat) to target different muscle recruitment patterns.

## Volume Metrics

- **Main Lift:** ~3-5 total sets (1-5 reps per set).
- **Supplemental Lift:** **5 sets of 10 reps**.
- **Total Volume Per Workout:** ~65+ reps.

## Summary

**Boring But Big** is a **straightforward** and **effective** volume-based training approach that complements **strength-focused programs** while adding significant hypertrophy work. Ideal for **intermediate to advanced lifters**, this method enhances muscular size, reinforces technique, and **progressively builds** work capacity over time. Proper recovery, structured progression, and **consistent execution** are crucial for maximizing results.

## Overview and Execution

The **Boring But Big (BBB) Ascending** variation is a structured **5x10 assistance work module** designed to develop **size, work capacity, and muscular endurance** while still complementing heavier strength work. Unlike the standard BBB format (which keeps the same weight for all sets), this variation **increases weight progressively** across the 5 sets.

### Execution:
- **Perform 5 sets of 10 reps** with **increasing weight each set**.
- **Recommended loading** (as a % of Training Max):
  - **Set 1** – 30% TM
  - **Set 2** – 40% TM
  - **Set 3** – 50% TM
  - **Set 4** – 60% TM
  - **Set 5** – 70% TM
- **Rest between sets**: 60–120 seconds.
- **Progression Options**:
  - Increase **each set** by 5 lbs per week.
  - Increase **the top set (Set 5)** by 2.5–5% per cycle while keeping earlier sets lighter.
  - Use a **three-phase cycle**:
    - **Cycle 1**: 30%-50% TM for all 5x10 sets.
    - **Cycle 2**: 40%-60% TM for all 5x10 sets.
    - **Cycle 3**: 50%-70% TM for all 5x10 sets.
  - After Cycle 3, **keep the final cycle’s top weight as the new baseline**.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If progression slows or fatigue becomes a limiting factor:
1. **Reduce jumps between sets** (e.g., increase in smaller increments like 5% instead of 10%).
2. **Deload** after three cycles by either:
   - Performing **3x10 instead of 5x10**.
   - Reducing weights by **10-20% for one cycle** before resuming progression.
3. **Modify assistance exercises** to reduce fatigue (e.g., substitute Romanian deadlifts for deadlifts).

## Example Application

A **185 lb intermediate lifter** with a **Training Max of 315 lbs for squat** could run this cycle:

### Week 1 (Introductory Phase)
- **Squat - 5x10**:
  - **Set 1**: 95 lbs (30% TM)
  - **Set 2**: 125 lbs (40% TM)
  - **Set 3**: 155 lbs (50% TM)
  - **Set 4**: 185 lbs (60% TM)
  - **Set 5**: 220 lbs (70% TM)
- **Rest:** 60-120 sec between sets.

### Week 2 (Progression)
- **Increase each set by ~5 lbs**:
  - **Set 1**: 100 lbs
  - **Set 2**: 130 lbs
  - **Set 3**: 160 lbs
  - **Set 4**: 190 lbs
  - **Set 5**: 225 lbs

### Week 3 (Peak Week)
- Increase **only the top set** by 5%:
  - **Set 1**: 100 lbs
  - **Set 2**: 130 lbs
  - **Set 3**: 160 lbs
  - **Set 4**: 190 lbs
  - **Set 5**: 235 lbs (Top Set +5%)

### Week 4 (Deload)
- **Squat - 3x10** @ 50% TM (~155 lbs)
- **Less volume, same movement pattern.**

## Important Notes

- **Start conservatively**—if 70% TM is too difficult for 10 reps, **reduce it slightly**.
- **Squats and deadlifts** can be **very taxing**—adjust percentages if necessary.
- **Superset pressing movements (bench/press) with lat work** for efficiency.
- **Grip work consideration**: If using **deadlifts**, straps are fine, but **double overhand grip** at lighter percentages is encouraged.
- **Avoid unnecessary additions**—the workload is **already substantial**.
- **Conditioning should align with goals**—adjust recovery and additional training accordingly.

## Volume Metrics

- **Total Volume per Session**: **5x10 per exercise**.
- **Total Reps per Exercise**: **50 reps**.
- **Progressive Workload**: **Ascending intensity ensures a smooth build-up of effort**.

## Summary

The **Boring But Big (Ascending Only)** approach provides a **structured progression within a high-volume framework**, making it an **excellent hypertrophy and work capacity tool** while still complementing heavy strength work. The **gradual intensity increase** helps **lifters adapt to heavier loads** while avoiding early-set fatigue. This module is **best suited for intermediate to advanced lifters** looking for a **balanced blend of hypertrophy and strength endurance**.

## Overview and Execution

The **Boring But Big (BBB) Descending** module is an assistance volume protocol aimed at building **muscular endurance, hypertrophy, and work capacity** after completing a heavier main movement. It follows a **descending weight structure** across 5 sets of 10 reps. The first set starts at **70% of Training Max (TM)** and decreases by **~10% per set**, allowing for high volume without excessive fatigue.

### Execution:
- Perform **5 sets of 10 reps**, reducing the load each set:
  - **Set 1:** 70% TM
  - **Set 2:** 60% TM
  - **Set 3:** 50% TM
  - **Set 4:** 40% TM
  - **Set 5:** 30% TM
- Rest **60-120 seconds** between sets.
- Supersetting with pulling movements (e.g., chin-ups, rows) is optional but can increase efficiency.

This method ensures that even as fatigue builds, **bar speed and rep quality** remain high, avoiding excessive breakdown in technique.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If performance stalls, consider the following adjustments:
- **Reduce the top-set weight slightly (e.g., 65% instead of 70%)** to better manage fatigue.
- **Increase rest intervals (120s max)** if struggling to complete all reps.
- **Cycle intensity over time** (e.g., starting a new cycle at 50-30% and progressing to 70-30% over several weeks).
- **Switch to a different movement variation** (e.g., front squats instead of back squats) to maintain stimulus while reducing cumulative fatigue.

## Example Application

### 4-Week Cycle Progression for an Intermediate 185 lbs Male

**Week 1:** 5x10 @ 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30% TM  
**Week 2:** Increase top set by **5 lbs** (e.g., 75%, 65%, 55%, 45%, 35% TM)  
**Week 3:** Progress to next cycle, adjusting weight as needed  
**Week 4 (Deload):** Reduce volume to **3x10 @ 50% TM**  

For a lifter with a **315 lb squat Training Max (TM):**  
- **Week 1 Example Weights:** 220 lbs, 190 lbs, 160 lbs, 130 lbs, 95 lbs  
- **Week 2:** Increase each by ~5 lbs, keeping the descending structure  
- **Week 3:** Continue gradual progression, ensuring all reps are executed with control

## Important Notes

- **Start conservatively** to manage fatigue, especially on **squats and deadlifts**.
- **Do not attempt to train to failure**—this method prioritizes **consistent high-quality reps**.
- **Superset pressing movements with lat work** to maximize efficiency.
- If **grip fatigue** is an issue on **deadlifts**, use straps for 5x10 work.
- **Removing the belt for squats and deadlifts** can enhance core engagement.
- If struggling with recovery, **reduce 5x10 deadlifts** and replace with **lighter posterior chain work** (e.g., good mornings, straight-leg deadlifts).

## Volume Metrics

- **5 sets of 10 reps per movement**
- **50 total reps per session**
- **High volume, but intensity is managed through a descending load structure**

## Summary

The **Boring But Big (BBB) Descending** module is a **hypertrophy-focused assistance template** that ensures **high-quality volume work** while avoiding excessive fatigue accumulation. By progressively lowering the weight each set, lifters can maintain **bar speed, rep quality, and technique** throughout the session. This makes it particularly effective for **building muscle, reinforcing movement patterns, and improving muscular endurance** without compromising strength development.

This module works well for **intermediate lifters** who want to incorporate more volume into their programming while managing fatigue smartly. Beginners can also use it with lighter percentages to adapt to high-rep training.

Overall, **BBB Descending is a structured and effective way to build size and endurance** while complementing a strength-focused approach like Wendler’s 5/3/1 program.

## Overview and Execution
The Boring But Big (BBB) Up/Down module consists of 5 sets of 10 reps, following a wave-like intensity pattern. The recommended percentages for each set are as follows:

1. **Set 1** – 50% of Training Max (TM)
2. **Set 2** – 60% of TM
3. **Set 3** – 70% of TM
4. **Set 4** – 60% of TM
5. **Set 5** – 50% of TM

This structure allows for a peak intensity set in the middle while maintaining volume and managing fatigue. The rest intervals between sets should range from 60–120 seconds. The method is self-regulating as the Training Max (TM) increases over time.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies
- If you struggle to complete all 5 sets at the prescribed weights, reduce the top set by 5-10% TM.
- Increase rest between heavier sets to maintain output.
- If progression slows, reset to a lighter TM and rebuild.

## Example Application
For an intermediate lifter with a 1RM squat of 405 lbs:

- **Week 1:** 5x10 @ 205, 245, 285, 245, 205 lbs
- **Week 2:** Increase the top set by 5 lbs → 5x10 @ 205, 245, 290, 245, 205 lbs
- **Week 3:** Progress top set by another 5 lbs → 5x10 @ 205, 245, 295, 245, 205 lbs
- **Week 4:** Deload by reducing volume or lowering percentages

## Important Notes
- Start conservatively, especially for lower body lifts, as the high rep scheme can be fatiguing.
- Pressing movements can be supersetted with lat work to save time.
- If the 5x10 deadlift is too taxing, substitute good mornings or Romanian deadlifts.
- Avoid excessive volume beyond what’s programmed—fatigue management is crucial.

## Volume Metrics
- **Total Reps per Exercise:** 50 (5 sets x 10 reps)
- **Total Volume Load:** Adjusted based on TM percentages

## Summary
The BBB Up/Down module balances hypertrophy and strength endurance through an undulating intensity pattern. This structure is ideal for intermediate lifters looking to improve work capacity while managing fatigue across a high-volume training session. It self-regulates with Training Max adjustments, making it an effective long-term strategy for muscle and strength gains.

### Overview and Execution

Perform **2 explosive reps on the minute** for 12 total minutes, aiming for **65–70%** of your 1RM. The emphasis is on bar speed—move the weight as quickly as possible while maintaining control. After each mini set, rest until the top of the next minute.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you notice your speed dropping significantly, reduce the weight or cut down to 10 sets to maintain explosiveness.
- If the weight feels too easy and speed is high, increase by 5 lb (or a small percentage) the next session.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 12 x 2 at 135 lb. Monitor bar speed; if it remains explosive through set 12, next session you can go to 140 lb.
- **Week 2**: 12 x 2 at 140 lb. If speed lags on the final sets, stay at 140 lb until it improves.

### Important Notes

- Keep each set as explosive as possible—this is “dynamic effort” work popularized by Westside Barbell.
- Maintain proper technique to avoid injury while moving the bar quickly.

### Volume Metrics

- **Total volume**: 12 × 2 = 24 reps.

### Summary

This module is ideal for improving explosive strength and power. By pairing moderate loads (65–70%) with low-rep, high-speed sets in an EMOM format, you train dynamic effort effectively while keeping total session time short.

## Overview and Execution

Autoregulatory Cluster Sets revolve around splitting a set into short mini-sets with brief rests (10–15 seconds). For instance:

- **Total Rep Goal**: 12 at 85% 1RM.
- **Execution**: Perform 2–4 reps, rest 10–15 sec, then continue until you reach 12 total reps.
- **Autoregulation**: If you find you need fewer mini-sets to reach 12 reps, increase load. If it becomes too difficult, you may either reduce the weight or add mini-sets.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Extend the Rest**: If performance stalls, increase the short intra-set rest from 15 sec to 20–30 sec.
- **Deload**: If still stalled, drop intensity to ~80% 1RM for a week before returning to 85%.

## Example Application

For a 185 lb lifter deadlifting ~400 lb 1RM:

- **Goal**: 12 total reps at 340 lb (85%).
- **Cluster**: 3 reps, rest 15 sec, 3 reps, rest 15 sec, etc., until 12 total.
- If next session you only need 3 mini-sets (3+3+6) to complete 12, you might increase load to 345–350 lb.

## Important Notes

- Great for building strength and power with near-max loads.
- Keep rests brief but not so short that form deteriorates.

## Volume Metrics

Often 12 total reps, though you may do multiple clusters in one workout. If you do two clusters of 12, that’s 24 near-max reps.

## Summary

Autoregulatory Cluster Sets allow high-intensity work with short, strategic rests within a set. This approach helps maintain bar speed and form at heavier loads, making it well-suited for intermediate and advanced lifters seeking performance and hypertrophy benefits.
