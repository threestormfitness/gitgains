## Overview and Execution

To perform the Power Clusters module, load the barbell to about 90% of your 1RM. Execute 2 explosive reps, then rack the weight and rest for approximately 15-20 seconds within the set. Continue this pattern until you complete 6 total reps per cluster (commonly split into multiple sets of 6×2). Allow roughly 2 minutes of rest between complete sets. This technique lets advanced lifters handle heavy weights with cleaner, more powerful reps, making it suitable for enhancing strength and power output.

## Example Application

For a practical application of this module, perform a cluster squat routine consisting of 6 sets of 2 reps, taking a 2-minute rest between sets. Each set may involve performing 2 reps, racking the bar for 15 seconds, and repeating another 2 reps until the cluster is complete. 

## Important Notes

This module is designed to improve power capacity using near-maximal loads without causing excessive fatigue. Lifters should focus on maintaining crisp technique throughout the session. This regimen is best suited for advanced lifters with a solid base in heavy barbell lifts.

## Volume Metrics

- **Total Reps**: 12 reps at approximately 90% 1RM across 6 sets.

## Summary

The Power Clusters (6×2 @ ~90%) module is a refined and advanced training strategy drawn from French Contrast and Cluster traditions. It is ideal for experienced trainees seeking to improve power and explosiveness with heavy weights. This approach allows for effective power development while minimizing the risk of fatigue, thereby enhancing overall lifting performance.
