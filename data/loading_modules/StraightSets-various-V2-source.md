Below are 10 straight set/rep “modules” that have been widely used and documented on reputable fitness sites, forums, and community resources (e.g. r/Fitness, T NATION, Bodybuilding.com, Starting Strength forums, etc.). Each includes:

- **Basic parameters** (sets x reps)
- **Progression strategy** (how to add weight/session progression)
- **Plateau strategy** (what to do if you stall/fail to progress)
- **Week-by-week or session-by-session example** (sample progression across multiple sessions)

They are presented so a new lifter can read and implement each module independently.

## 1) 3×8

**References**: Commonly seen in introductory bodybuilding routines on Bodybuilding.com and the r/Fitness wiki.

- **Sets & Reps**: 3 sets of 8 reps
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - Start with a weight you can handle for all 3 sets of 8 (leaving 1–2 reps “in the tank”).
    - Each session, if you successfully complete 3×8 with good form, add 5 lb (or 2.5 kg) next session for that lift.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - If you fail to get 8 reps across all 3 sets two workouts in a row, reduce the load by ~10% for the next session.
    - Build back up from there in 5 lb increments.
- **Session-by-Session Example**:
    1. **Session 1**: 3×8 @ 100 lb
    2. **Session 2**: 3×8 @ 105 lb (increased by 5 lb)
    3. **Session 3**: 3×8 @ 110 lb (again +5 lb, assuming success)
    4. **Session 4**: Fail to get all 8 reps on the 3rd set (e.g., 8, 8, 6). Next session, retry 110 lb.
    5. **Session 5**: If fail again, deload ~10% and do 3×8 @ ~100 lb. Then continue from there.

## 2) 4×6

**References**: Popularized in various strength/hypertrophy-focused routines on T NATION and the Lyle McDonald forums.

- **Sets & Reps**: 4 sets of 6 reps
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - Choose a weight you can do for 6 reps with proper form, but it should be challenging on the last set.
    - Add 2.5–5 lb each session if you hit 6 reps on all 4 sets.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - If you cannot complete 6 reps on at least 3 of the 4 sets for two consecutive sessions, reduce the load by ~5–10%.
    - Try to progress again in smaller increments (2.5 lb jumps instead of 5 lb).
- **Week-to-Week Example**:
    - **Week 1**: 4×6 @ 150 lb
    - **Week 2**: 4×6 @ 155 lb (if all sets hit 6 reps)
    - **Week 3**: 4×6 @ 160 lb
    - **Week 4**: Fail to complete 6 on all sets (e.g., 6, 6, 5, 5). Next week, retry 160 lb.
    - **Week 5**: If fail again, deload to ~145 lb and build back up in smaller increments.

## 3) 5×5 (Linear Progression)

**References**: StrongLifts 5×5, Bill Starr 5×5, Madcow 5×5 programs.

- **Sets & Reps**: 5 sets of 5 reps (usually the same working weight across sets in beginner variants like StrongLifts).
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - Add 5 lb each successful session (especially for squats, bench, rows).
    - For smaller lifts (like overhead press), some people add 2.5 lb.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - If you fail to get 5 reps for all 5 sets two sessions in a row, deload by ~10%.
    - Work back up in 5 lb increments.
- **Session-to-Session Example**:
    - **Session 1**: 5×5 @ 100 lb
    - **Session 2**: 5×5 @ 105 lb
    - **Session 3**: 5×5 @ 110 lb
    - **Session 4**: Fail at 110 lb (e.g., 5, 5, 5, 4, 3). Next session, retry 110 lb.
    - **Session 5**: If fail again, deload to 100 lb. Then move back up.

## 4) 3×5 (Starting Strength-Style)

**References**: Mark Rippetoe’s “Starting Strength.”

- **Sets & Reps**: 3 sets of 5 reps
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - Increase weight by 5 lb each successful workout for bigger lifts (squat, bench, deadlift if you do multiple sets).
    - For overhead press or smaller exercises, you may need 2.5 lb jumps.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - Upon failing 3×5 for the same weight two or three sessions in a row, deload by 10%.
    - Build back up by repeating the incremental jumps.
- **Session-by-Session Example**:
    1. **Session 1**: 3×5 @ 135 lb
    2. **Session 2**: 3×5 @ 140 lb
    3. **Session 3**: 3×5 @ 145 lb
    4. **Session 4**: Fail at 145 lb (5, 4, 3). Next session, retry 145 lb.
    5. **Session 5**: If fail again, deload to ~130 lb and resume linear progression.

## 5) 5×3

**References**: Sometimes recommended by Mark Rippetoe for more advanced/experienced lifters who need heavier loads with fewer reps.

- **Sets & Reps**: 5 sets of 3 reps
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - Because reps are lower, you can often handle heavier weights but progress in smaller steps.
    - Start with a weight you can perform for 3 reps with 1–2 reps in reserve.
    - Increase by 2.5–5 lb if you succeed in all 5 sets of 3.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - If you fail the same weight twice, deload by ~10%.
    - Optionally, reduce the number of sets to 3 for a week as a slight “reset,” then go back to 5 sets the following week.
- **Week-by-Week Example**:
    - **Week 1**: 5×3 @ 185 lb
    - **Week 2**: 5×3 @ 190 lb
    - **Week 3**: Fail at 195 lb (3, 3, 2, 2, 2). Next week, retry 195 lb.
    - **Week 4**: If fail again, deload ~10% (175 lb) for 5×3. Next progression step is +5 lb each time.

## 6) 3×10

**References**: Found in many traditional “bodybuilding splits” (e.g., old Bodybuilding.com routines, Arnold-era references).

- **Sets & Reps**: 3 sets of 10 reps
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - Start with a weight where you can complete all 10 reps on each set with moderate difficulty.
    - Add 2.5–5 lb each session if you complete 3×10 successfully.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - If stuck (e.g., fail 10 reps in the last set) two sessions in a row, reduce the load by 5–10% and build back up.
    - Consider smaller jumps (2.5 lb) if needed.
- **Session-by-Session Example**:
    - **Session 1**: 3×10 @ 80 lb
    - **Session 2**: 3×10 @ 85 lb (success)
    - **Session 3**: 3×10 @ 90 lb (fail on last set: 10, 9, 7). Next session, retry 90 lb.
    - **Session 4**: If fail again, deload to ~80 lb and progress back up.

## 7) 3×12

**References**: Commonly found in higher-rep hypertrophy blocks, e.g., the r/Fitness wiki’s hypertrophy guidelines, Bodybuilding.com articles.

- **Sets & Reps**: 3 sets of 12 reps
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - Start with a weight you can do 12 reps for all sets, but the last few reps in the final set should be challenging.
    - Increase by 2.5–5 lb each time you can complete all 3 sets of 12.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - If you fail the same weight two sessions in a row, deload by ~10%.
    - Progress back up using smaller increments if needed.
- **Week-by-Week Example**:
    - **Week 1**: 3×12 @ 70 lb
    - **Week 2**: 3×12 @ 75 lb
    - **Week 3**: Fail on last set at 80 lb (12, 12, 9). Next week, retry 80 lb.
    - **Week 4**: If fail again, deload to 70 lb and build up again.

## 8) 4×8

**References**: Often used in intermediate bodybuilding programs, sometimes in the r/Fitness recommended routines.

- **Sets & Reps**: 4 sets of 8 reps
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - Pick a weight you can manage for 8 reps with a bit of effort left in the tank on the first 2 sets, but 4th set is tough.
    - Increase by 2.5–5 lb when you can do 8 reps on all sets comfortably.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - If you miss reps in the last 1–2 sets, retry the same weight next session.
    - If you miss again, deload by 5–10%.
- **Week-to-Week Example**:
    1. **Week 1**: 4×8 @ 100 lb
    2. **Week 2**: 4×8 @ 105 lb
    3. **Week 3**: 4×8 @ 110 lb (fail last set: 8, 8, 8, 6). Next week, retry 110 lb.
    4. **Week 4**: If fail again, deload to 100 lb and continue.

## 9) 10×3 (Higher-Set, Lower-Rep)

**References**: Chad Waterbury’s routines on T NATION popularized the 10×3 method.

- **Sets & Reps**: 10 sets of 3 reps
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - The idea is to use a heavy load but keep each set short (3 reps).
    - Increase by 2.5–5 lb after completing 10×3 with the assigned weight across all sets.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - If failing to hit all 3 reps in multiple sets two sessions in a row, drop the load by 5–10%.
    - Ensure increment steps remain small enough to continue progression.
- **Session-by-Session Example**:
    1. **Session 1**: 10×3 @ 150 lb
    2. **Session 2**: 10×3 @ 155 lb
    3. **Session 3**: Fail on the 8th, 9th, 10th sets (e.g., 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1). Next session, retry 155 lb.
    4. **Session 4**: If fail again, deload to ~140 lb, build back up.

## 10) 5×10 (High-Volume)

**References**: Common in “Boring But Big” (Wendler’s 5/3/1 accessory style) and German Volume Training variations.

- **Sets & Reps**: 5 sets of 10 reps
- **Progression Strategy**:
    - Typically done with a lighter percentage of your 1RM (e.g., 50–60%).
    - Increase weight by 5 lb when all 5 sets reach 10 reps with relative ease.
- **Plateau Strategy**:
    - If you can’t complete 10 reps in each set for two attempts, back off by 5–10%.
    - Often the focus is on volume, so ensure not to jump too quickly in weight.
- **Week-by-Week Example**:
    - **Week 1**: 5×10 @ 100 lb
    - **Week 2**: 5×10 @ 105 lb
    - **Week 3**: 5×10 @ 110 lb (fail some reps on the 4th/5th sets). Next week, retry 110 lb.
    - **Week 4**: If fail again, deload to 95 lb and climb back up in 5 lb steps.

### General Notes (Apply to All Modules)

1. **Rest Times**: Typically, 1–3 minutes between sets is standard for these rep schemes. (Exact rest intervals depend on your goals, but no specific rest intervals are mandated here, since we’re focusing on the set/rep “module” only.)
2. **Small Plates**: Especially for pressing movements, or for smaller individuals, 2.5 lb (or even 1.25 lb) microplates can be beneficial to continue progressing linearly.
3. **Deload**: Whenever a plateau strategy mentions “deload ~10%,” you can adjust that percentage based on how significant the stall is. Some people do 5%, others do 10–15%.
4. **Consistency**: Tracking every session is crucial (e.g., keep a log of sets/reps/weight) to ensure accurate progression or deload decisions.

These modules can be inserted in any broader program for a particular exercise (squat, bench, etc.) as needed, letting you choose whichever set/rep scheme best fits your overall structure. No diet, rest, or full-program advice is given here—just the loading modules for your database.
