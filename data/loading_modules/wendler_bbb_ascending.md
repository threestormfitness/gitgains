## Overview and Execution

The **Boring But Big (BBB) Ascending** variation is a structured **5x10 assistance work module** designed to develop **size, work capacity, and muscular endurance** while still complementing heavier strength work. Unlike the standard BBB format (which keeps the same weight for all sets), this variation **increases weight progressively** across the 5 sets.

### Execution:
- **Perform 5 sets of 10 reps** with **increasing weight each set**.
- **Recommended loading** (as a % of Training Max):
  - **Set 1** – 30% TM
  - **Set 2** – 40% TM
  - **Set 3** – 50% TM
  - **Set 4** – 60% TM
  - **Set 5** – 70% TM
- **Rest between sets**: 60–120 seconds.
- **Progression Options**:
  - Increase **each set** by 5 lbs per week.
  - Increase **the top set (Set 5)** by 2.5–5% per cycle while keeping earlier sets lighter.
  - Use a **three-phase cycle**:
    - **Cycle 1**: 30%-50% TM for all 5x10 sets.
    - **Cycle 2**: 40%-60% TM for all 5x10 sets.
    - **Cycle 3**: 50%-70% TM for all 5x10 sets.
  - After Cycle 3, **keep the final cycle’s top weight as the new baseline**.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If progression slows or fatigue becomes a limiting factor:
1. **Reduce jumps between sets** (e.g., increase in smaller increments like 5% instead of 10%).
2. **Deload** after three cycles by either:
   - Performing **3x10 instead of 5x10**.
   - Reducing weights by **10-20% for one cycle** before resuming progression.
3. **Modify assistance exercises** to reduce fatigue (e.g., substitute Romanian deadlifts for deadlifts).

## Example Application

A **185 lb intermediate lifter** with a **Training Max of 315 lbs for squat** could run this cycle:

### Week 1 (Introductory Phase)
- **Squat - 5x10**:
  - **Set 1**: 95 lbs (30% TM)
  - **Set 2**: 125 lbs (40% TM)
  - **Set 3**: 155 lbs (50% TM)
  - **Set 4**: 185 lbs (60% TM)
  - **Set 5**: 220 lbs (70% TM)
- **Rest:** 60-120 sec between sets.

### Week 2 (Progression)
- **Increase each set by ~5 lbs**:
  - **Set 1**: 100 lbs
  - **Set 2**: 130 lbs
  - **Set 3**: 160 lbs
  - **Set 4**: 190 lbs
  - **Set 5**: 225 lbs

### Week 3 (Peak Week)
- Increase **only the top set** by 5%:
  - **Set 1**: 100 lbs
  - **Set 2**: 130 lbs
  - **Set 3**: 160 lbs
  - **Set 4**: 190 lbs
  - **Set 5**: 235 lbs (Top Set +5%)

### Week 4 (Deload)
- **Squat - 3x10** @ 50% TM (~155 lbs)
- **Less volume, same movement pattern.**

## Important Notes

- **Start conservatively**—if 70% TM is too difficult for 10 reps, **reduce it slightly**.
- **Squats and deadlifts** can be **very taxing**—adjust percentages if necessary.
- **Superset pressing movements (bench/press) with lat work** for efficiency.
- **Grip work consideration**: If using **deadlifts**, straps are fine, but **double overhand grip** at lighter percentages is encouraged.
- **Avoid unnecessary additions**—the workload is **already substantial**.
- **Conditioning should align with goals**—adjust recovery and additional training accordingly.

## Volume Metrics

- **Total Volume per Session**: **5x10 per exercise**.
- **Total Reps per Exercise**: **50 reps**.
- **Progressive Workload**: **Ascending intensity ensures a smooth build-up of effort**.

## Summary

The **Boring But Big (Ascending Only)** approach provides a **structured progression within a high-volume framework**, making it an **excellent hypertrophy and work capacity tool** while still complementing heavy strength work. The **gradual intensity increase** helps **lifters adapt to heavier loads** while avoiding early-set fatigue. This module is **best suited for intermediate to advanced lifters** looking for a **balanced blend of hypertrophy and strength endurance**.
