### Overview and Execution

Use ~80% 1RM to maintain explosiveness. Perform 4 fast, powerful reps. If needed, rest ~15 seconds inside the set to reset your explosiveness, then continue. Complete 6 total sets, resting 2–3 minutes between sets. Increase weight slightly (2.5–5 lbs) once you maintain high speed across all reps.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If bar speed slows too much, reduce load or increase rest between sets. Power emphasis is key, so you never want grinding reps.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a 225 lb power clean 1RM:

- Perform sets at ~180 lbs (80%).
- 4 fast reps, rest 15s if needed (or do them in one go if you can maintain speed), then rest 2 min.
- After 6 sets, if speed was consistent, try 185 lbs next session.

### Important Notes

- This is specifically for power development.
- Technique and explosive intent trump total reps.

### Volume Metrics

- **6 sets × 4 reps = 24 total reps** at moderate-high intensity.

### Summary

6×4 cluster sets provide enough rest to maintain explosive power in each set. Ideal for intermediate or advanced athletes focusing on speed-strength qualities rather than pure hypertrophy.
