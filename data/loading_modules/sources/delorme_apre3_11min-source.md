# APRE (3RM) Protocol

## Overview
The **Autoregulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise (APRE) 3RM method** is designed for **maximal strength development**. It prioritizes **low reps and high intensity**, making it ideal for athletes and lifters focused on **absolute strength**. Unlike fixed progression models, APRE dynamically adjusts weights based on **real-time performance**, ensuring optimal training loads every session.

## Structure
The APRE (3RM) method consists of **four sets**, with the last two sets dictating weight adjustments for the next session.

| **Set** | **Reps & Load** |
|---------|----------------|
| 0 (Warm-up) | Light warm-up sets |
| 1 | **6 reps at 50% of 3RM** |
| 2 | **3 reps at 75% of 3RM** |
| 3 | **AMRAP (as many reps as possible) at 3RM (93% of 1RM)** |
| 4 | **Adjusted weight based on Set 3 performance** |

## Load Adjustment Guidelines
The weight for the **next session** is determined based on performance in Set 3:

| **Reps in Set 3** | **Next Session Adjustment** |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **1-2 reps** | **Decrease 5-10 lb** |
| **3-4 reps** | **Keep the same weight** |
| **5-6 reps** | **Increase 5-10 lb** |
| **7+ reps** | **Increase 10-15 lb** |

## Load Selection Guidelines
- **Starting weight:** Select a **true 3RM** (a weight where failure occurs at 3 reps).
- **Adjust weight session-to-session**: Based on Set 3 performance.
- **Prioritize explosive, high-quality reps**: Avoid grinding out poor-quality reps.

## Rest Intervals
- **Set 1-2:** ~1-2 minutes
- **Set 3:** ~3-4 minutes
- **Set 4:** ~4-5 minutes (heavy loads)

## Execution / Key Considerations
- **Autoregulation for peak strength**: Ensures **progressive overload without excessive fatigue**.
- **Best for experienced lifters**: Since it's high-intensity, it's **not ideal for beginners**.
- **Ideal for low-rep compound lifts**: Deadlifts, squats, presses, cleans, etc.
- **Less frequent deloading needed**: The system **self-regulates**, reducing overtraining risks.

## Summary
APRE (3RM) is a **high-intensity, autoregulated strength training method**. By **dynamically adjusting weights** based on Set 3 output, lifters can **maximize strength gains** while minimizing fatigue. This method is **ideal for powerlifters, strength athletes, and advanced lifters** looking to **increase their 1RM efficiently**.
