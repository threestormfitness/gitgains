## Overview and Execution

The 6-4-2 Wave Loading module involves performing three sets with consecutive intensity increases. Start with a set of 6 reps at moderate intensity (~75% of max), followed by a rest period of 2-3 minutes. The second set comprises 4 reps at a heavier load (~85%), with another rest, ending with 2 reps at near-maximal load (~90%). Advanced trainers can perform additional waves with slightly increased weights if performance remains strong.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

In case of a plateau, consider incorporating a deload week to allow recovery. If you notice a significant drop in bar speed, it may be a sign to pause and reassess your load or volume.

## Example Application

For a lift like the deadlift, an intermediate to advanced 185 lbs male might execute the following over a session:
- First wave: 6 reps at 315 lbs, 4 reps at 335 lbs, 2 reps at 355 lbs.
- Second wave (if capable): 6 reps at 320 lbs, 4 reps at 340 lbs, 2 reps at 360 lbs.

This showcases a structured approach to strength increment.

## Important Notes

Stop the session if the bar speed slows drastically. This module is excellent for bridging strength and hypertrophy, typically incorporating 1-2 waves per session per lift. Avoid unnecessary training to failure; focus on maintaining form and bar speed.

## Volume Metrics

Each wave consists of 12 reps in total, balancing between strength and hypertrophy stimulus.

## Summary

The 6-4-2 Wave Loading module is an interval-based strength regimen designed for intermediate to advanced lifters striving to enhance their compound lift performance. It combines strategic loading and structured rest to optimize muscle growth and strength. Beneficial as a bridge between phases or when hybrid strength-hypertrophy goals are targeted, it places a key emphasis on controlled progression and autoregulation.
