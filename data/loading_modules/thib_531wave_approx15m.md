## Overview and Execution

Thibaudeau’s 5-3-1 Wave is a strength-focused loading strategy that uses **2–3 waves** of descending repetitions (5, 3, and 1). Each wave increases the load for each set, and subsequent waves start with a heavier load than the previous wave did for the same rep count. Key points:

- **Waves**:  
  - **Wave 1**: 5 reps → 3 reps → 1 rep  
  - **Wave 2**: 5 reps (heavier than Wave 1’s 5-rep load) → 3 reps (heavier) → 1 rep (heavier)  
  - **Wave 3 (optional)**: If you still feel strong and maintain form, repeat the same 5-3-1 pattern at slightly heavier loads.
- **Load Ranges**: Typically **80–95% of 1RM**, but adjust according to performance.
- **Rest Intervals**: Approximately **2 minutes** between sets; increase if needed for heavier singles.
- **Progression**: Each wave should challenge you more than the last, but avoid grinding or incomplete reps.

This approach is somewhat “auto-regulated” since you can decide mid-workout if an additional wave is feasible without sacrificing form or speed.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

While this module does not specifically detail extensive plateau-busting methods, here are general recommendations:

- **Reduce the Number of Waves**: If performance declines, stick to 2 total waves or even just 1 wave in a session.
- **Reset Loads**: If you fail to hit your target reps or feel consistently unable to complete the wave, reduce your training weights by 5–10% and build back up.
- **Technique Check**: Ensure proper form and bar speed—stalling might be linked to technical breakdown rather than pure strength limitation.

## Example Application

Below is a practical example of two waves for an intermediate to advanced trainee (~185 lbs) aiming for a 1RM around 365 lbs in a given lift (e.g., back squat).

Wave 1: 5 reps at 85%, 3 reps at 90%, 1 rep at 92.5% Wave 2: 5 reps at 87.5%, 3 reps at 92.5%, 1 rep at 95%

To put this into real numbers (approximate):
- **1RM Assumption**: 365 lbs
- **85%** ≈ 310 lbs
- **87.5%** ≈ 320 lbs
- **90%** ≈ 330 lbs
- **92.5%** ≈ 340 lbs
- **95%** ≈ 350 lbs

**Session Flow** (after thorough warm-up):  
- **Wave 1**:  
  1. **5 reps** @ 310 lbs  
  2. **3 reps** @ 330 lbs  
  3. **1 rep** @ 340 lbs  
- **Wave 2**:  
  4. **5 reps** @ 320 lbs  
  5. **3 reps** @ 340 lbs  
  6. **1 rep** @ 350 lbs  

If you feel strong and have solid bar speed, you might add a **Wave 3**, jumping each load by ~5–10 lbs from Wave 2’s corresponding set.

### Multi-Session Progression Example (Over Several Weeks)

Assume you repeat this 2-wave setup once weekly:

- **Week 1**:  
  - Wave 1 loads: (85%, 90%, 92.5%)  
  - Wave 2 loads: (87.5%, 92.5%, 95%)  
- **Week 2**:  
  - Increase each set by 5 lbs from previous week’s corresponding sets if all reps were completed with good form.  
- **Week 3**:  
  - Continue adding small load increments if performance remains strong.  
- **Week 4**:  
  - If bar speed slows or form deteriorates, consider a lighter “Wave 1” or reduce to 2 total sets per wave (e.g., 5-rep, 1-rep, skipping the 3-rep set).

## Important Notes

- **Effective for building strength with moderate volume.**  
- **Avoid grinding failures**—stop a wave early if form or speed suffers.  
- **Adjust the number of waves** based on daily performance and recovery status.

## Volume Metrics

- Each wave = **5 + 3 + 1 = 9 reps**  
- Two waves = **18 reps**  
- Three waves = **27 reps**  

Though the volume (total reps) is relatively low, the intensity is high, and the repeated exposure to heavy loads can be very effective for neurological adaptations.

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s 5-3-1 Wave module is ideal for intermediate to advanced trainees seeking a potent strength stimulus. By cycling through progressively heavier 5-rep, 3-rep, and 1-rep sets, you challenge the body both in terms of volume (moderate) and intensity (high). The approach remains auto-regulated, letting you add or remove waves based on daily readiness. This makes it a versatile, time-efficient strategy for driving steady strength gains without excessive risk of burnout.
