## Overview and Execution

The "Boring But Big" variation of the 5/3/1 program focuses on combining traditional 5/3/1 strength sets with high-volume accessory work. Each session starts with three main sets of a major lift at 65%, 75%, and 85% of your Training Max (TM), following the 5/3/1 scheme. These are followed by 5 sets of 10 repetitions (5×10) of the same lift or an alternate lift at approximately 50% of your TM to encourage hypertrophy.

### Example Setup

- **Bench Day**: Perform 5/3/1 sets for the bench press, then complete 5×10 bench press at 50% TM.
- **Cycle pattern**: Week 1 uses 5 reps with intensity at 65/75/85%.

Importantly, these accessory sets are designed to build muscle endurance, with short rest periods to maximize workload.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you find yourself unable to complete the 5×10 accessory sets, it's recommended to reduce the weight slightly and progressively increase as strength and endurance improve over time.

## Example Application

- **Week 1**: Main lift at 65/75/85% for 5 reps each set, followed by 5×10 accessory work at 50%.
- **Week 2 and 3**: Increase the main lift intensity (planned in 5/3/1 methodology) while maintaining accessory work at increased, yet manageable, loads if initial 5×10 was easy.
- **Week 4**: Deload week for recovery.

An intermediate 185 lbs male lifter could aim to bench press at percentages of a TM around 250 lbs, adjusting accessory work if fatigue sets in prematurely.

## Important Notes

Focus heavily on the volume in the accessory sets post-main lifts. Watch recovery and adapt rest as needed, keeping it shorter for BBB sets to emphasize muscle growth. This variation is a classic hypertrophy model within the 5/3/1 program.

## Volume Metrics

The total workout volume per session comprises 3 main working sets and 5 high-volume accessory sets, creating an extensive yet structured program layout of 8 sets each workout.

## Summary

The "Boring But Big" variation of Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 program is designed for intermediate lifters aiming to build muscle size while maintaining foundational strength. The program emphasizes a blend of strength and hypertrophy through manageable, methodical volume increases over a four-week cycle. With a careful balance between resting and lifting loads, this module effectively promotes muscle endurance and growth.
