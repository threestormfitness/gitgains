  "overview_and_execution": "Pick your 5RM. Perform 5 reps, rest 15s, then do 1 rep, rest 15s, do 1 rep, rest 15s, do 1 rep (8 total). Do 3 such sets, resting 3–5 min between. If all reps are completed, add weight (~5 lbs) next session. Limit usage to 2–4 weeks.",
  "example_application": "An intermediate lifter with a 200 lb bench press 5RM does 5 reps at 200, rests 15s, does 1 rep, rests 15s, does 1 rep, rests 15s, does 1 rep for 8 total. Then rests 3–5 min and repeats for 3 sets.",
  "important_notes": "Avoid failure. If you miss reps, try to improve next time. Stop after 2–4 weeks to prevent burnout.",
  "volume_metrics": "3 sets x 8 reps = 24 total reps per session"
