## Overview and Execution

Perform four total sets per exercise with this framework:

1. **Set 1:** ~12 reps at ~50% of your estimated 10RM  
2. **Set 2:** ~10 reps at ~75% of your estimated 10RM  
3. **Set 3 (AMRAP):** As many reps as possible at your 10RM load  
4. **Set 4 (Adjusted Load):** Choose weight based on Set 3 performance and do another set

For rest, take about **1 minute** between the lighter sets, then **2–5 minutes** before the heavier sets (Sets 3 & 4). This allows partial recovery while preserving enough intensity to hit meaningful rep ranges. The key principle is autoregulation: after each session, the weight for your next workout is determined by how many reps you completed on Set 3.

---

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This APRE method is inherently designed to minimize plateaus because you adjust load based on your performance. If your reps in Set 3 drop unexpectedly, you simply reduce the weight next session. If you exceed target reps, you increase the weight. Below is the **Autoregulation Chart** for reference:

| **Reps in Set 3** | **Next Session Adjustment** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 4–6               | Decrease 5–10 lb           |
| 7–8               | Decrease 0–5 lb            |
| 9–11              | Keep the same weight       |
| 12–16             | Increase 5–10 lb           |
| 17+               | Increase 10–15 lb          |

## Example Application

Suppose an intermediate, 185 lb male trainee estimates a **10RM** on squats at **200 lb**:

- **Week 1, Day 1**  
  - **Set 1:** 12 reps at ~100 lb (about 50% of 10RM)  
  - **Set 2:** 10 reps at ~150 lb (about 75% of 10RM)  
  - **Set 3 (AMRAP):** AMRAP at 200 lb; trainee completes 12 reps  
  - **Set 4:** Use the same 200 lb for 8–10 reps (or as many as possible while maintaining form)

  Since the trainee got 12 reps on Set 3 (in the 12–16 range), next session the 10RM load will increase by **5–10 lb** (e.g., from 200 to 205–210 lb).

- **Week 1, Day 2**  
  - Adjust the 10RM load to ~205 lb based on the previous performance.  
  - Repeat the same set structure.  
  - If the trainee still hits ~10–12 reps on Set 3, next time they might increase to 210–215 lb, and so on.

This session-to-session adjustment continues, ensuring progress remains steady without hitting significant plateaus.

## Important Notes

- **Choose an accurate 10RM** to start. If you’re unsure, begin with a conservative estimate and adjust upward if you exceed target reps.  
- **Avoid grinding reps**—the goal is steady progression.  
- **Adjust weight up or down** based on performance in Set 3.  
- **Rest more** before heavier sets to maintain rep quality.  
- **Minimal need for deloads**—the autoregulation inherently manages fatigue.

## Volume Metrics

You will typically complete **4 working sets** per exercise. The first two sets are relatively lighter (~12 and ~10 reps), followed by an AMRAP set (Set 3) and a final heavy set (Set 4). Overall volume is therefore in the **high-rep** range compared to lower-rep strength programs.

## Summary

Thomas DeLorme’s APRE 10RM protocol is an autoregulated approach ideal for **hypertrophy and work capacity**. It dynamically adjusts load based on real-time performance, helping lifters progress consistently without lengthy plateau phases. This method suits beginner-to-intermediate lifters who want higher-rep work and a straightforward, self-correcting way to add intensity over time.
