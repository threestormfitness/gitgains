| **overview_and_execution**     | `The Three Storm Triple Pyramid is a bodyweight or mixed-modality workout involving three distinct exercises with varied rep multipliers. You start at 1 rep for the first exercise, 2 for the second, and 3 for the third, increasing each step until reaching a peak (ideally step 10), then descend back to 1. Start with a 1-6-1 pyramid structure and progressively work up to 1-10-1.` |
| **example_application**        | `An intermediate trainee might select Ring Pullups x1, Ring Dips x2, and Kettlebell Swings x3. On step 1, they perform 1 pullup, 2 dips, and 3 swings. By step 6, they complete 6 pullups, 12 dips, and 18 swings, before reversing back down to step 1.` |
| **important_notes**            | `Mix and match exercises based on your goals and fitness level. Ensure the chosen movements have compatible difficulty levels to maintain intensity without overtraining. Avoid combining heavy spine-loaded exercises with core-centric movements to ensure proper bracing.` |
| **volume_metrics**             | `1x exercises: 36-100 reps, 2x exercises: 72-200 reps, 3x exercises: 108-300 reps depending on pyramid steps completed.` |

## Overview and Execution

The Three Storm Triple Pyramid builds endurance, strength, and muscular stamina through progressive repetition schemes. Select three exercises based on your fitness goals. Use rep multipliers (x1, x2, x3) to adjust the difficulty, ensuring a balanced workout. Begin with a 1-6-1 pyramid and gradually increase to 1-10-1 as your capacity improves.

Ensure the exercises complement each other: for instance, pairing pushing and pulling movements with a lower-body or core-focused exercise. An example could be:
- **Pulling Movement (x1)**: Pullups, Rows, or Ring Pullups.
- **Pushing Movement (x2)**: Pushups, Dips, or Bench Press.
- **Lower/Full-body/Core Movement (x3)**: Situps, Kettlebell Swings, or Squats.

Rest minimally between exercises, but adjust as needed for fatigue and form integrity.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you struggle to reach your intended peak (e.g., step 8), finish the workout with as many reps as possible. Track your total reps and aim to beat them in subsequent sessions. If progress stalls over multiple workouts, reduce the intensity, swap exercises, or lower the pyramid's peak before gradually increasing volume again.

## Example Application

An intermediate 185 lbs trainee selects:
- **Ring Pullups (x1)**
- **Ring Dips (x2)**
- **Kettlebell Swings (x3)**

**Week 1:** Start with a 1-6-1 pyramid.
- Step 1: 1 Pullup, 2 Dips, 3 Swings
- Step 2: 2 Pullups, 4 Dips, 6 Swings
- Step 3: 3 Pullups, 6 Dips, 9 Swings
- Step 4: 4 Pullups, 8 Dips, 12 Swings
- Step 5: 5 Pullups, 10 Dips, 15 Swings
- Step 6: 6 Pullups, 12 Dips, 18 Swings
- Then descend back to Step 1.

**Progression:** Add one more step in subsequent weeks until reaching a 1-10-1 pyramid.

## Important Notes

- Select exercises based on your fitness level and equipment availability.
- Adjust multipliers to avoid overtraining or underloading.
- Avoid combining core-heavy exercises with spine-loaded movements to maintain proper form.
- Progressively increase pyramid peaks while monitoring for fatigue and plateaus.

## Volume Metrics

- **1x exercises:** 36-100 reps
- **2x exercises:** 72-200 reps
- **3x exercises:** 108-300 reps

These metrics depend on the number of steps completed in the pyramid.

## Summary

The Three Storm Triple Pyramid is a flexible, endurance-building workout adaptable to all fitness levels. Its progression structure fosters consistent strength gains while accommodating various movement combinations to target multiple muscle groups. Ideal for those looking to improve muscular stamina and overall conditioning through scalable, autoregulated training.
