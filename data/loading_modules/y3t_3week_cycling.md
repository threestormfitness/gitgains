## Overview and Execution

The Y3T module is designed to cycle through different rep ranges to promote hypertrophy by shocking the muscle growth. Each cycle lasts 3 weeks:

- **Week 1**: Focus on heavy loads with 6-10 reps per set.
- **Week 2**: Transition to moderate loads with 10-14 reps per set.
- **Week 3**: Finish with lighter loads and high reps of 20+ per set.

Adjusting the loads at each phase ensures that you approach failure within the intended rep ranges, providing a varied stimulus for muscle growth.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

While no specific plateau strategies are mentioned, the autoregulated nature of this program allows trainees to adjust intensities each week. If stalling, consider adjusting rest intervals or incorporating drop sets and rest-pause techniques.

## Example Application

**Leg Day Cycle**:
- **Week 1**: Perform exercises with 6-10 reps per set. Choose weights that bring you near failure at this range.
- **Week 2**: Adjust the weight for 10-14 reps per set.
- **Week 3**: Finally, use lighter weights aiming for 20-25 reps per set.

**Example Session for Legs**:
- **Exercise 1 (Squats)**: W1: 3 sets x 6-10 reps, W2: 3 sets x 10-14 reps, W3: 3 sets x 20-25 reps.
- **Exercise 2 (Leg Press)**: Similarly, alter the weights, maintaining intensity across weeks.

This cycle ensures progressive overload and adaptation throughout the course of workouts.

## Important Notes

- This program is quite intense, ensuring variation in rep ranges to target overall hypertrophy effectively.
- Each cycle spans 3 weeks, after which you should increase the weight for another cycle if repeating.
- It’s crucial to regulate intensities autonomously and avoid complete failure until the last sets.

## Volume Metrics

Total sets will depend on the specific exercise selection and the intensity adjustments made weekly. Ensure coverage of all muscle groups targeted.

## Summary

The Y3T 3-week cycle by Neil Hill is optimal for stimulating hypertrophy through varied load and rep ranges, ensuring continuous muscular adaptation. Best suited for intermediate to advanced bodybuilders seeking to train with varied intensities. Adjust each week’s load to maximize failure rhythms aligned with rep ranges. This module facilitates autoregulation and includes optional techniques like drop sets and rest-pause for additional growth stimulus. Repeating cycles with incrementally heavier loads supports long-term progression.
