## Overview and Execution

The 5/3/1 + First Set Last (FSL) Variation utilizes the main progression of Jim Wendler's original 5/3/1 program. The module incorporates the "First Set Last" technique to add extra volume and promote hypertrophy. In each session, perform three main sets using the specified percentages for that week (e.g., Week 1: 65% x 5, 75% x 5, 85% x 5+). After completing the main sets, reduce the weight back to the percentage of the first set (approximately 65%) and perform 5 sets of 5 reps (5×5). Rest periods should be moderate to manage the additional volume.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If progress stalls, consider adjusting the AMRAP set intensity or slightly decreasing the weights to reset and continue building strength. Deload every 4th week to allow for recovery and adaptation, mitigating potential plateaus.

## Example Application

- **Week 1 (Squat):**  
   - 65% x 5  
   - 75% x 5  
   - 85% x 5+ (AMRAP)  
   - FSL: 5×5 @ 65%

- **Week 2 (Squat):**  
   - 70% x 3  
   - 80% x 3  
   - 90% x 3+ (AMRAP)  
   - FSL: 5×5 @ 70%

Follow a similar progression with other main lifts, adjusting percentages according to personal maxes.

## Important Notes

FSL is powerful for adding volume and targeting hypertrophy. Maintain a moderate rest between sets to effectively handle the 5×5 volume. Deload every 4th week to allow recovery.

## Volume Metrics

Each training session includes 3 main sets followed by FSL sets, totaling 8 sets for the primary lift. This contributes to overall volume without exceeding regular time limits.

## Summary

The 5/3/1 + FSL Variation is ideal for lifters looking to increase strength while adding hypertrophy through additional volume. It fits well with both intermediate and advanced trainees who can handle its demands. With structured progressions and periodic deloads, this module promotes continuous gains.
