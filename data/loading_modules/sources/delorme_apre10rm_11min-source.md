# APRE (10RM) Protocol

## Overview
The **Autoregulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise (APRE) 10RM method** is designed for **hypertrophy and work capacity**. It dynamically adjusts training loads based on performance, ensuring optimal intensity and volume for each session. The protocol adapts to daily fluctuations in strength, preventing undertraining or excessive fatigue.

## Structure
The APRE (10RM) method consists of **four sets**, with the last two sets dictating weight adjustments for the next session.

| **Set** | **Reps & Load** |
|---------|----------------|
| 0 (Warm-up) | Light warm-up sets |
| 1 | **12 reps at 50% of 10RM** |
| 2 | **10 reps at 75% of 10RM** |
| 3 | **AMRAP (as many reps as possible) at 10RM (75% of 1RM)** |
| 4 | **Adjusted weight based on Set 3 performance** |

## Load Adjustment Guidelines
The weight for the **next session** is determined based on performance in Set 3:

| **Reps in Set 3** | **Next Session Adjustment** |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **4-6 reps** | **Decrease 5-10 lb** |
| **7-8 reps** | **Decrease 0-5 lb** |
| **9-11 reps** | **Keep the same weight** |
| **12-16 reps** | **Increase 5-10 lb** |
| **17+ reps** | **Increase 10-15 lb** |

## Load Selection Guidelines
- **Initial 10RM estimate**: Choose a weight where **failure occurs around 10 reps**.
- **Adjust progressively**: If reps exceed expectations, increase load; if fewer reps are completed, decrease.
- **Avoid grinding reps**: The goal is steady progression, not absolute failure.

## Rest Intervals
- **Set 1-2:** ~1 minute
- **Set 3:** ~2-3 minutes
- **Set 4:** ~3-5 minutes (heavier loads)

## Execution / Key Considerations
- **Autoregulation in action**: This method **removes guesswork** from programming by dynamically adjusting weights.
- **Minimized need for deloads**: The adaptive nature of APRE reduces overtraining risks.
- **Best for hypertrophy & endurance**: Higher rep work increases **muscular endurance and size**.
- **Works well with compound movements**: Ideal for **squats, presses, deadlifts, pull-ups**.

## Summary
APRE (10RM) is a **self-regulating** training method that ensures **continuous progress** without the pitfalls of static programming. By dynamically adjusting weights based on performance, athletes can **train effectively regardless of daily fluctuations in strength**. It is particularly useful for **hypertrophy-focused** lifters who want to **optimize work capacity** without excessive fatigue or burnout.
