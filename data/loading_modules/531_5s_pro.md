## Overview and Execution

Each main set of the 5/3/1 – 5s Pro Variation is performed for 5 strict reps, focusing on percentages of your training max (TM), which is approximately 90% of your true 1RM. Over the course of three weeks, the percentages increase as follows:

- **Week 1**: 65%, 75%, 85%
- **Week 2**: 70%, 80%, 90%
- **Week 3**: 75%, 85%, 95%

No additional reps beyond five are necessary (no AMRAP). After three weeks of progression, a deload is implemented in Week 4 to facilitate recovery, after which the training max can be adjusted upwards.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

While this module does not extensively cover stalling strategies, using deeper volume work like the Boring But Big protocol can aid in overcoming plateaus by increasing workload and supporting muscle hypertrophy.

## Example Application

**Week 1 - Squat:**
- 65% × 5 reps
- 75% × 5 reps
- 85% × 5 reps

**Week 2 - Progression:**
- 70% × 5 reps
- 80% × 5 reps
- 90% × 5 reps

**Week 3 - Progression:**
- 75% × 5 reps
- 85% × 5 reps
- 95% × 5 reps

After the cycle, increase your training max by 5-10 lbs for upper-body lifts and 10-15 lbs for lower-body lifts in the succeeding cycle.

## Important Notes

The program is submaximal in nature, ensuring a focus on form and consistency in volume. It's most effective when paired with additional volume work, like Boring But Big, to complement the strength sets.

## Volume Metrics

For each main lift:

- Total of 3 sets × 5 reps per session, adding up to 15 reps per main lift.

## Summary

The 5/3/1 – 5s Pro Variation by Jim Wendler is designed for lifters aiming to build foundational strength with a clear, methodical approach. The focus on strict sets at submaximal weights ensures safety and form, particularly suitable for intermediate to advanced trainees looking to maintain progression without pushing to failure. This balanced regimen promotes longevity in training and adequate recovery, aligning with the principles of prudent strength development.
