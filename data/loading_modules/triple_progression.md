## Overview and Execution

The Triple Progression Model is designed for gradual overload, ideal for novice to intermediate lifters. Begin with a weight you can perform for 3 sets of 6 reps. With each session, aim to add reps across the sets, advancing toward 3 sets of 8 reps. Upon achieving this with good form and control, increase the weight and revert to 3 sets of 6 reps. Maintain consistent rest intervals of 90 to 120 seconds between sets, and manage intensity by using moderate loads, approximately 70-80% of your 1RM. Avoid training to failure; cease sets when you are 1-2 reps shy of failure.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

Should you encounter a plateau, consider implementing a deload week or changing rep schemes temporarily to avoid stalling. Additionally, ensure adequate recovery and nutrition to support progress.

## Example Application

- **Day 1**: DB Shoulder Press - 50 lbs x 3×6
- **Day 2**: DB Shoulder Press - 50 lbs x 3×7
- **Day 3**: DB Shoulder Press - 50 lbs x 3×8
- **Day 4**: Increase weight to 55 lbs, and perform - 55 lbs x 3×6
- **Continue this cycle**: Increase reps again, maintaining form and rest consistency.

## Important Notes

- Focus on proper form, particularly when approaching higher reps.
- Consistency in rest intervals (90-120s) is crucial for recovery and performance.
- The program accommodates autoregulation to allow for personal adaptability each session.

## Volume Metrics

The module consists of 3 sets, potentially reaching up to a total of 24 reps at the top end, adhering to a moderate intensity range.

## Summary

The Triple Progression Model is an effective framework for those seeking gradual, methodical strength improvements. Primarily intended for beginner to intermediate lifters, it emphasizes steady progress through a structured increase in repetitions and sustainable overload, making it an accessible and practical training module.
