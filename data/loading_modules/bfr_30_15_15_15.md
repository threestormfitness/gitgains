## Overview and Execution

Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) Occlusion Training involves the use of a strap to apply pressure to the muscle region being worked. For this module, once the occlusion strap is applied, execute a sequence of 30 reps, followed by a short rest of approximately 30 seconds, then perform 15 reps, rest again, perform another 15 reps, rest, and finally 15 more reps. The strap remains on throughout the entire set, and it is removed after completing all sets. This is designed to exhaust the muscle using low loads, contributing significantly to hypertrophy.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This module does not specifically address stalling. Given the short, high-rep nature of the protocol at low intensity, progression typically involves adjusting the intensity within the prescribed range or increasing the number of reps slightly across sessions.

## Example Application

An example of this module in practice would be using the leg extension machine. Begin with a weight set at approximately 20% of your one-repetition maximum (1RM). Perform 4 sets of 30-15-15-15 repetitions with the occlusion strap applied throughout. Rest for about 30 seconds between mini-sets. This session keeps the muscle engorged with blood, maximizing the effectiveness of the light load.

## Important Notes

- This training approach is particularly effective for inducing hypertrophy with low loads and minimal joint strain.
- Carefully monitor the sensations during training; excessive pain or numbness is a signal to stop and reassess the occlusion pressure or technique.
- Best used for isolation exercises where joint-friendly practices are a priority.

## Volume Metrics

The total volume of this module is 75 reps per session (30+15+15+15).

## Summary

BFR Occlusion Training (30-15-15-15) is an innovative approach targeting muscle hypertrophy at low intensity, making it ideal for individuals focused on reducing joint stress while maximizing muscle engagement. Best suited for intermediate to advanced trainees, this module leverages short rest intervals to maintain muscle tension and promote substantial muscle growth.
