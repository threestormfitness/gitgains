# GZCLP Tier 3 Loading Module

## Overview

GZCLP Tier 3 (T3) focuses on **accessory exercises** (e.g., rows, pulldowns, and other isolation work) to address weak points, add muscle mass, and reinforce the main lifts (T1 and T2). It uses **higher rep ranges** and AMRAP sets to ensure sufficient volume for growth.

## Structure

1. **3×15** with the **last set as AMRAP** (15+).
    - For instance, the first two sets are 15 reps each, and the final set is as many reps as possible.
2. **Progress When** you reach **25+ reps** on the last set.
    - Increase the load for the next workout once you can comfortably exceed ~25 reps in your final AMRAP set.

_(If a T3 exercise is too easy at 15 reps to start, you can adjust the initial load accordingly—just keep the same progression logic.)_

## Load Selection Guidelines

- **Start Light**: Choose a weight you can manage for 15 reps without grinding.
- **Increment**: Add small weights (5 lb or less) once you hit that 25+ AMRAP threshold.
- **Exercise Choice**: Common T3 moves include lat pulldowns, dumbbell rows, or similar back/arm/shoulder accessory work.

## Rest Intervals

- **1–1.5 minutes** between T3 sets.
- This tier is higher-rep accessory work, so shorter rests are typically fine.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Keep T3 movements relatively lighter to ensure strict form and reduce injury risk.
- Monitor fatigue—especially as you approach higher rep totals on the AMRAP set.
- T3 volume can be increased over time to transition to a broader GZCL approach (e.g., turning a T3 into a T2 if it becomes a major focus).

## Summary

Tier 3 in GZCLP targets **accessory and isolation work**, using high-rep sets and a final AMRAP to drive hypertrophy and structural balance. Small progressive overload steps ensure long-term gains without excessive fatigue, complementing T1 and T2 lifts effectively.
