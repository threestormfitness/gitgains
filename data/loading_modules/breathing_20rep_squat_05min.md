## Overview and Execution

The 20-Rep Breathing Squat is an intensive training module highlighting both strength and mental fortitude. Executed with a 10RM load, this exercise involves performing 20 reps with strategic rest. After reaching the 10th rep, the lifter should take deep breaths as needed between each subsequent rep to complete the entire set. This blend of maximal effort and extended breathing rituals acts as an autophysiological hack, enabling the lifter to push beyond typical limits. The primary objective is to add 5-10 lbs each session, providing certain critical mass and strength gains over the cycle.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If a lifter encounters stalling or missed reps, it is advisable to maintain the same weight for the next session and focus on improving breathing technique and mental readiness. If stalling persists, a slight deload might be necessary before attempting to increase the load again.

## Example Application

Consider a lifter squatting 200 lbs. During the routine:
- Start the set with 200 lbs.
- Squat for 10 reps with good form.
- For reps 11-20, take 3-5 deep breaths between each attempt, pushing through each repetition with determination.
- After completing all 20 reps, increment the load by 5-10 lbs in the next session.

Continue this progression across different sessions over the span of six weeks.

## Important Notes

- This module is highly demanding and should only be conducted in short cycles to prevent burnout.
- It pairs effectively with a calorie-surplus diet, facilitating muscle growth and recovery.
- Ensure proper form to minimize injury risk, given the heavy and extended nature of this exercise.

## Volume Metrics

The core volume metric for this program is executing 1 set of 20 reps, resulting in high-intensity output per session.

## Summary

The 20-Rep Breathing Squat stands as a testament to the old-school strength programs designed to build massive muscle and mental strength in a short period. Typically reserved for athletes and lifters with an established strength foundation, this program promises substantial gains when adhered to with discipline and a robust nutritional support system. Ideal for intermediate and advanced trainees, it's a time-tested method for breaking through plateaus and achieving new levels of performance.
