# GZCLP Tier 1 Loading Module

## Overview

GZCLP Tier 1 (T1) is the primary loading scheme for the core barbell lifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press) in the GZCLP program. It uses a **wave-based linear progression** to help beginners and early intermediates steadily increase strength by adjusting rep ranges once a certain volume “fails.”

## Structure

1. **Start:** 5×3 with the **last set as AMRAP** (3+).
    - Your target “base volume” is 15 total reps (e.g., 5 sets × 3 reps each).
    - Increase weight each workout as long as you hit at least 15 total reps across all sets.
2. **If you fail to reach 15 reps total**, drop to 6×2 with the **last set as AMRAP** (2+).
    - New target base volume: 12 total reps (6 sets × 2 reps).
    - Continue adding weight each workout until you fail to reach 12 total reps.
3. **If you fail at 6×2**, drop to 10×1 with the **last set as AMRAP** (1+).
    - Target base volume: 10 total reps (10 singles).
    - Keep adding weight each workout until you fail to reach 10 total singles.
4. **When you fail at 10×1**, rest 2–3 days and then test a new 5RM.
    - Restart the cycle at **85%** of this new 5RM for 5×3+ again.

## Load Selection Guidelines

- **Starting Weight**: Use your last successful linear progression weight or test a 5RM and start at ~85%.
- **Increment**: Typically add **5 lb** for Bench/Overhead Press and **10 lb** for Squat/Deadlift each T1 session.
- **AMRAP Caution**: Avoid going much beyond ~10 reps in your AMRAP set, even if you have extra in the tank.

## Rest Intervals

- **3–5 minutes** between T1 sets.
- Adjust based on performance and time, but prioritize enough rest to maintain quality on heavy sets.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Push T1 AMRAP sets close to—but not to absolute—failure (leave 1–2 reps in reserve).
- Once base volume can’t be met, move to the next lower rep “wave” rather than forcing extra sets.
- Best for novice to intermediate lifters who can recover from frequent jumps in weight and volume.

## Summary

GZCLP Tier 1 offers a **simple yet effective wave progression** for key barbell lifts. Each time you stall in one rep range, you move to fewer reps per set but keep overall volume as high as possible, extending linear progress before needing a reset. It’s ideal for building strength in a straightforward, repeatable fashion.
