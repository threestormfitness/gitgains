## Overview and Execution

To perform the Ladder Sets module, begin by executing 1 rep of the chosen exercise (e.g., pull-ups), then rest briefly (around 10 seconds). Follow with 2 reps, rest again, and then 3 reps, completing the first ladder. Optionally increase to 5 reps, and then descend back to 1. Repeat this cycle for several ladders. The program is designed to accumulate volume without quickly inducing fatigue, adhering to a moderate intensity (~70% 1RM). Use this format with exercises like kettlebells, bodyweight movements, or barbells for versatility and adaptability.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If unable to complete the top rung of your ladder, adjust by reducing the max rung or decreasing the total number of ladders.

## Example Application

A common application of this module is performing pull-ups:
- Complete 1 pull-up, rest ~10 seconds
- Perform 2 pull-ups, rest again
- Conclude with 3 pull-ups, rest, then repeat

If a plateau occurs, scale back by performing 1, 2, and 3 reps, reducing ladders as needed to suit fatigue levels.

## Important Notes

- This module is excellent for practicing submaximal sets, allowing for skill enhancement and gradual strength progression with cumulative volume.
- It is particularly suited for skill-based lifts or bodyweight progressions due to the less intense nature of each individual set.

## Volume Metrics

Each rung of a ladder sums up to 6 reps (1+2+3). When performed over 3 ladders, this results in a total of 18 reps.

## Summary

The Ladder Sets module is a versatile training method originating from Russian Kettlebell tradition. Suitable for both intermediate and advanced trainees, it emphasizes balance in volume and intensity. By focusing on submaximal loading and efficient rest periods, it presents an excellent opportunity to build skill and strength across a variety of exercises without overreaching. Whether implemented with kettlebells, bodyweight, or barbell movements, this module supports a robust training regimen.
