# GZCLP Tier 2 Loading Module

## Overview

GZCLP Tier 2 (T2) is the **secondary** compound lift progression in GZCLP. It runs alongside the T1 lifts but uses **moderate loads** and **higher reps** to build additional volume and support the main T1 movement.

## Structure

1. **Start:** 3×10 (10 reps each set) for a total of 30 reps.
    - Add weight each session as long as you can complete all 30 reps across the 3 sets.
2. **If you fail to reach 30 total reps**, drop to 3×8 (24 total reps).
    - Keep adding weight each workout until you fail to hit 24 total reps across the sets.
3. **If you fail at 3×8**, drop to 3×6 (18 total reps).
    - Continue adding weight until you fail to reach 18 reps.
4. **Reset**: After 3×6 stalls, you can cycle back to 3×10 at a **slightly heavier** starting weight (no more than +15–20 lb / ~+9 kg) than before.

## Load Selection Guidelines

- **Starting Weight**: Use a weight you can confidently handle for the full set/rep target (e.g., your last known T2 weight if cycling through again).
- **Increment**: Add small increments each time (e.g., 5 lb for upper lifts, 10 lb for lower lifts) until you stall.
- **Progression Cycles**: Typically repeat 2–3 cycles of 10→8→6 reps before considering a more advanced GZCL approach (e.g., different movement in T2).

## Rest Intervals

- **2–3 minutes** between T2 sets.
- Enough rest to maintain proper form on moderate rep ranges.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- The T2 lift for a given day often becomes T1 in a subsequent session (e.g., if Day 1 T1 is Squat, T2 might be Bench, and they swap roles on Day 2).
- Make sure to maintain good technique for higher reps—fatigue accumulates quickly.
- This tier helps drive hypertrophy, technique practice, and supportive volume for the main lifts.

## Summary

GZCLP Tier 2’s **3×10 → 3×8 → 3×6** progression provides additional volume and lighter practice to reinforce your main lifts. It steadily increases load in manageable increments, ensuring ongoing adaptation without overwhelming recovery.
