## Overview and Execution

This module involves performing a wave loading pattern of 8, 6, 4, and 2 reps. Start with 8 reps at a moderate load (~70% of 1RM), then rest for 2-3 minutes. Next, perform 6 reps at a heavier load (~75%), rest, then 4 reps at even heavier (~80%), rest again, and finish with 2 reps at the heaviest load (~85%). Focus on controlled negatives throughout the sets. Advanced trainees may perform multiple waves (e.g., two waves of 8-6-4-2), adjusting loads based on performance.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you encounter a plateau, a deload phase is recommended. This may involve reducing the intensity for a session or two before resuming the program with adjusted weights.

## Example Application

For an intermediate trainee, an example application on the bench press might be:

- 8 reps × 185 lbs
- 6 reps × 205 lbs
- 4 reps × 225 lbs
- 2 reps × 245 lbs

In subsequent sessions, attempt small load increases (e.g., 5-10 lbs) if the previous wave was completed successfully.

## Important Notes

This program is particularly effective for bridging the gap between hypertrophy and strength training. Proper management of rest intervals is crucial to maintain performance and prevent overtraining. Over the course of multiple sessions, aim to gradually increase the weights for optimal progression.

## Volume Metrics

Each wave consists of 20 total reps (8+6+4+2).

## Summary

The 8-6-4-2 Wave Loading program is designed for intermediate to advanced trainees looking to enhance both hypertrophy and strength. By gradually increasing the intensity and adjusting for performance, this module encourages continuous strength development and progression without immediately hitting plateaus.
