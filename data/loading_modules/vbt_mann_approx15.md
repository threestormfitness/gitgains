## Overview and Execution

VBT bases training on bar speed rather than a percentage of 1RM or RPE. You set a velocity threshold for the given goal (e.g., 0.6 m/s for strength-focus). Perform 3–5 reps per set and monitor each rep’s speed:

- **Stop** the set when the speed dips below the threshold.
- **Progress** the load if you maintain or exceed the target velocity in all reps across all sets.
- **Deload** or reduce load if velocity consistently falls short.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Adjust Velocity Threshold**: If you stall, either lower the threshold temporarily to work on strength, or raise it to emphasize power.
- **Lighter Speed Sessions**: Use periods of lower load/higher bar speed to recover while honing technique.

## Example Application

For an intermediate 185 lb lifter with a ~400 lb squat 1RM:

- **Goal**: Work in a zone around 0.6 m/s. Start at ~70% (280 lb).
- Perform sets of 3 reps, monitoring velocity each rep. If any rep drops below 0.6 m/s, end that set.
- If all sets stay above 0.6 m/s, add 5–10 lb next session.

## Important Notes

- Need a velocity device (e.g., Tendo unit, GymAware, or smartphone app).
- Emphasizes technique consistency because bar path influences velocity readings.

## Volume Metrics

Commonly 4–6 sets of 3–5 reps, though total volume depends on how quickly velocity drops in each set.

## Summary

Velocity-Based Training introduces precise autoregulation by measuring bar speed. It’s particularly popular in athletic settings where power development is critical. Good for intermediate/advanced lifters who have the tools to measure velocity and want to optimize training load in real time.
