## The Pendulum Wave Approach

### Overview
The pendulum wave approach cycles through various wave loading schemes each week for a set cycle (e.g., 3 weeks or more). It provides frequent variation in rep ranges and stimuli, appealing to lifters who crave variety or adapt quickly to a single scheme.

### Structure
- **Example 6-Week Pendulum**  
  - Week 1: 7-5-3  
  - Week 2: 5-3-1  
  - Week 3: 3-2-1  
  - Week 4: 6-4-2  
  - Week 5: 3-2-1  
  - Week 6: 2-2-1

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Each week begins somewhat conservatively, as you’ll be dealing with different rep targets.  
- Aim to push loads within each scheme but maintain solid form.

### Rest Intervals
- Still stick to 90–180 seconds.  
- Monitor fatigue week to week because the rep ranges jump around.

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Suited for lifters who dislike monotony or who plateau quickly with a single wave scheme.  
- Offers a broad stimulus for both strength and hypertrophy across different rep ranges.  
- Keep track of your loads and progress from cycle to cycle.

### Summary
Pendulum waves let you “swing” between different wave schemes weekly, preventing boredom and staleness. It can spark new progress in advanced lifters by regularly changing training stimuli.
