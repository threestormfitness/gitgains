  "overview_and_execution": "Perform 4 sets using a 3RM base. Set 1 at ~50% for 6 reps, Set 2 at ~75% for 3 reps, Set 3 AMRAP at 3RM, Set 4 adjusts weight based on that performance. Next session’s weight also adjusts per the rep count in Set 3.",
  "example_application": "If a lifter’s 3RM back squat is 280 lb, do 140 lb x 6 reps, 210 lb x 3 reps, then AMRAP at 280 lb. If 5 reps are achieved, add 5–10 lb next session for the top set.",
  "important_notes": "Always use a true 3RM start. Adjust load based on AMRAP performance. Emphasize explosive reps rather than grinding. Designed for advanced lifters focusing on strength.",
  "volume_metrics": "4 total work sets; roughly 6 + 3 + (3–7) + 3 reps each session"
