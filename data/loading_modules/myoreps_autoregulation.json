  "overview_and_execution": "Choose a weight for 10-20 reps as an activation set. Go near failure, rest 10s, do a mini-set of 3-5 reps. Continue mini-sets (with 10s rest) until speed or reps drop. Log total reps.",
  "example_application": "Chest press machine: 15 reps (activation), rest 10s, 5 reps, rest 10s, 4 reps, rest 10s, 4 reps, final 3 reps. Stop if rep speed slows too much.",
  "important_notes": "Good for hypertrophy with minimal volume. Track total reps and aim to improve over sessions. Great on machines or stable exercises.",
  "volume_metrics": "1 extended set can yield 20-30 total reps"
