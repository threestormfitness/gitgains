## Overview and Execution

This mesocycle aims to progressively build muscle through a structured hypertrophy program over 4-6 weeks. Start the first week at approximately 3 RIR (Reps in Reserve) with sets ranging from 8 to 12 reps per exercise. As weeks progress, either increase the volume by adding an extra set or increase the load to maintain intensity at around 2 RIR. In the final week, approach 1 RIR or the point of failure. A deload follows in week 5 or 6 to facilitate recovery.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you experience stalling, examine your session intensity and ensure adherence to the RIR guidelines. Increasing RIR by adding sets or slightly increasing load can help navigate plateaus. Monitoring and precise adjustment are key.

## Example Application

For a Leg Day session:
- Week 1: 4 sets of squats (8-12 reps at ~3 RIR)
- Week 2: Increase to 5 sets or increase the load slightly while keeping reps in the 8-12 range and aiming for ~2 RIR
- By the final week, reduce RIR to ~1 by adjusting load or volume, before performing a deload.

## Important Notes

Focus on incremental overload and carefully track RIR through the cycle. This module is best suited for those targeting moderate volume hypertrophy without pushing to failure until the final week.

## Volume Metrics

The total weekly sets per muscle group should vary between 10-20, increasing up to 15+ across the mesocycle as appropriate for each muscle group.

## Summary

Dr. Israetel’s Hypertrophy Mesocycle is tailored for individuals looking to increase muscle mass through a combination of compound and isolation movements. It's designed for moderate-volume hypertrophy, suited for intermediate trainees who can regulate their training intensity accurately. The program guides you through progressive overload while emphasizing the importance of RIR for sustained muscle growth.
