## Overview and Execution

The 5/3/1 program is designed for strength progression through a calculated progression of sets and reps over a four-week cycle. The key is using a "training max," which is 90% of your true one-rep max (1RM). For three weeks, you alternate through different set and rep schemes with progressive intensity, culminating in a deload week before recalculating your training max and starting the cycle anew.

### Weekly Breakdown:
- **Week 1**: 65%×5, 75%×5, 85%×5+ (AMRAP on the last set).
- **Week 2**: 70%×3, 80%×3, 90%×3+.
- **Week 3**: 75%×5, 85%×3, 95%×1+.
- **Week 4**: Deload.

After completing Week 4, increase your training max by 5 lbs for upper-body lifts and 10 lbs for lower-body lifts.

## Example Application

For an intermediate 185 lbs male with a squat 1RM of 315 lbs, calculate the training max at 90%:
- Training Max = 315 lbs × 0.9 = 283 lbs.

**Cycle Application for Squat**:
- **Week 1**: Squat 185 lbs × 5, 212 lbs × 5, 240 lbs × 5+.
- **Week 2**: Squat 198 lbs × 3, 226 lbs × 3, 255 lbs × 3+.
- **Week 3**: Squat 212 lbs × 5, 240 lbs × 3, 269 lbs × 1+.
- **Week 4**: Deload (reduce intensity significantly, focusing on technique).

## Important Notes

- Focus on a manageable progression—small increment increases per cycle are key.
- The AMRAP (as many reps as possible) set helps gauge your progress and allows autoregulation based on your performance.
- Minimal accessory work or customization should be tailored according to the trainee's specific needs.

## Volume Metrics

Each workout features 3 main sets, with the potential additional reps on the last set dependent on AMRAP performance.

## Summary

The 5/3/1 program is ideal for those looking to focus on strength gains through consistent, steady progression. It is adaptable for intermediate to advanced lifters who are familiar with their 1RM and want a structured, yet adjustable routine. The flexibility in autoregulation and emphasis on major lifts makes it a versatile part of any strength training regimen.
