### Overview and Execution

This approach is a **3/2/1 wave** repeated **3 times**, each wave occupying 3 consecutive minutes. In minute one, you do 3 reps at a moderate load (around 70–74% of 1RM, depending on the wave). Next minute is 2 reps at a slightly heavier weight, and the third minute is 1 rep at the heaviest load of that wave. Repeat for a total of 3 waves (9 minutes).

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail on a single or the set feels near failure, lower your top weight by 2–3% next time.
- You can also reduce the total waves from 3 down to 2 if the last wave is too difficult, then work back up.

### Example Application

- **Wave 1**:
    - Minute 1: 3 reps at 70%
    - Minute 2: 2 reps at 75%
    - Minute 3: 1 rep at 80%
- **Wave 2**:
    - Minute 4: 3 reps at 72%
    - Minute 5: 2 reps at 77%
    - Minute 6: 1 rep at 82%
- **Wave 3**:
    - Minute 7: 3 reps at 74%
    - Minute 8: 2 reps at 79%
    - Minute 9: 1 rep at 84%

For an intermediate 185 lb lifter with an estimated 1RM of 300 lb on a squat or bench, these percentages translate to incrementally heavier loads on each wave.

### Important Notes

- Proper form is critical; as intensity rises each wave, avoid letting technique slip.
- Ensure rest for the remainder of each minute after your reps—recovery is key to hitting the next wave effectively.

### Volume Metrics

- **9 sets total** across 3 waves of 3/2/1, equaling **18 reps** in total.

### Summary

Wave EMOMs blend moderate to heavy loads in short bursts, progressively intensifying each wave. This structure trains the lifter to handle heavier loads in a condensed timeframe, enhancing both strength and technique under fatigue.
