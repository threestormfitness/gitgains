  "overview_and_execution": "Choose 2 exercises (often antagonistic). Set a 15 min timer. Alternate sets of 5-10 reps, resting just enough to maintain form. Record total reps completed. Next session, beat that total.",
  "example_application": "A1: Chin-up, A2: Dips, 15 min. Score = 50 total chin-ups + 50 total dips = 100 reps. Next time aim 105+ total.",
  "important_notes": "Keep each mini-set sub-failure so you can sustain. Great for hypertrophy and conditioning. A “PR Zone” approach fosters incremental progress.",
  "volume_metrics": "All sets done within 15 min, aim to exceed prior total reps each session"
