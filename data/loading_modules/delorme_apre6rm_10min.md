## Overview and Execution

The APRE 6RM module consists of four total work sets, each with a specific goal:

1. **Set 1**: 10 reps at approximately 50% of your 6RM.  
2. **Set 2**: 6 reps at approximately 75% of your 6RM.  
3. **Set 3**: AMRAP (as many reps as possible) with a weight near your true 6RM (~85% of 1RM).  
4. **Set 4**: Adjust the load based on Set 3 performance (using the chart below) and perform another set (usually aiming for 6 reps).

Rest intervals scale with intensity:
- **Set 1–2**: ~1–2 minutes  
- **Set 3**: ~2–3 minutes  
- **Set 4**: ~3–5 minutes (heavier, more demanding)

Because this approach is autoregulated, you dynamically adjust the load from one session to the next using the number of reps you achieved in Set 3:

| **Reps in Set 3** | **Next Session Adjustment** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| **0-2 reps**      | Decrease 5-10 lb           |
| **3-4 reps**      | Decrease 0-5 lb            |
| **5-7 reps**      | Keep the same weight       |
| **8-12 reps**     | Increase 5-10 lb           |
| **13+ reps**      | Increase 10-15 lb          |

Focus on compound lifts (squat, deadlift, press, row) or other multi-joint exercises that benefit from progressive overload and autoregulation.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you consistently hit the lower rep ranges (0–2 reps in Set 3) for multiple sessions in a row, you may need to reset your 6RM to a more realistic load. This is an indication that your initial estimate might be too heavy or you need a temporary decrease in training volume/intensity to recover before rebuilding.

---

## Example Application

Here’s how an intermediate (185 lb) lifter might structure the APRE 6RM squat session over several workouts:

- **Workout 1**  
  - Estimated 6RM: 200 lb  
  - Set 1: 10 reps @ 100 lb (50%)  
  - Rest 1–2 min  
  - Set 2: 6 reps @ 150 lb (75%)  
  - Rest 2–3 min  
  - Set 3 (AMRAP): ~8 reps @ 200 lb  
  - Rest 3–5 min  
  - Set 4: Keep the same load (or add 5 lb if desired) based on the 8 reps in Set 3

- **Next Session**  
  - Based on 8 reps, increase next session’s load by 5–10 lb.  
  - Continue the same set/rep scheme.  
  - If eventually you drop down to only 3–4 reps in Set 3, reduce or maintain the load accordingly at the next session.

Over time, you track your progress by the number of reps you achieve in Set 3 and adjust load for the following sessions to ensure continual improvement.

---

## Important Notes

- Identify your **true 6RM** (where you fail at 6 reps with good form) before starting.
- Always track **AMRAP performance** in Set 3 to drive load progression.
- Emphasize **good form**; do not chase extra reps with technique breakdown.
- Rest periods are **longer** on heavier sets to ensure adequate recovery.

---

## Volume Metrics

- **Total Work Sets**: 4
- **Total Reps**: Approximately 20–30 per session for each exercise (e.g., ~10 + 6 + AMRAP + ~6).

## Summary

APRE 6RM is a powerful combination of strength and hypertrophy training that adjusts automatically to daily performance fluctuations. Ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters looking to progress without constant 1RM testing, it leverages an AMRAP set to inform how you load the bar in subsequent sessions. The result is a sustainable, responsive training model that helps break plateaus and foster consistent improvement.
