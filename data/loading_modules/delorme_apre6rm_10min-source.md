# APRE (6RM) Protocol

## Overview
The **Autoregulatory Progressive Resistance Exercise (APRE) 6RM method** balances **strength and hypertrophy**. It provides **moderate volume with high intensity**, making it ideal for **building muscle while increasing strength**. The APRE system ensures that **each session is optimally adjusted** based on your performance, reducing the need for frequent deloads.

## Structure
The APRE (6RM) method consists of **four sets**, with the last two sets dictating weight adjustments for the next session.

| **Set** | **Reps & Load** |
|---------|----------------|
| 0 (Warm-up) | Light warm-up sets |
| 1 | **10 reps at 50% of 6RM** |
| 2 | **6 reps at 75% of 6RM** |
| 3 | **AMRAP (as many reps as possible) at 6RM (85% of 1RM)** |
| 4 | **Adjusted weight based on Set 3 performance** |

## Load Adjustment Guidelines
The weight for the **next session** is determined based on performance in Set 3:

| **Reps in Set 3** | **Next Session Adjustment** |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| **0-2 reps** | **Decrease 5-10 lb** |
| **3-4 reps** | **Decrease 0-5 lb** |
| **5-7 reps** | **Keep the same weight** |
| **8-12 reps** | **Increase 5-10 lb** |
| **13+ reps** | **Increase 10-15 lb** |

## Load Selection Guidelines
- **Starting weight:** Select a **true 6RM** (a weight where failure occurs at 6 reps).
- **Adjust weight dynamically**: Performance in Set 3 dictates next sessionâ€™s weight.
- **Prioritize quality reps**: Avoid grinding out excessive reps with poor form.

## Rest Intervals
- **Set 1-2:** ~1-2 minutes
- **Set 3:** ~2-3 minutes
- **Set 4:** ~3-5 minutes (heavier loads)

## Execution / Key Considerations
- **Autoregulation for strength & size**: Ensures **consistent overload without overtraining**.
- **Ideal for intermediate & advanced lifters**: Works well for those who need **both strength and hypertrophy**.
- **Best for compound lifts**: Squats, deadlifts, presses, and rows benefit most.
- **Less need for 1RM testing**: PRs happen organically over time.

## Summary
APRE (6RM) is a **hypertrophy-strength hybrid** method that **adapts to daily fluctuations in performance**. By **dynamically adjusting weights** based on Set 3 output, lifters can **maximize gains while minimizing unnecessary fatigue**. This makes it a **powerful tool for sustainable strength and muscle growth**.
