## Overview and Execution

The Smolov Jr. program is an intense 3-week training cycle focused on either the squat or bench press. Each week consists of 4 challenging sessions, with the following structure: 
- Day 1: 6 sets of 6 reps at 70% 1RM
- Day 2: 7 sets of 5 reps at 75% 1RM
- Day 3: 8 sets of 4 reps at 80% 1RM
- Day 4: 10 sets of 3 reps at 85% 1RM

Progression occurs by adding 5-10 lbs each successive week. After completing the 3-week cycle, a new one-rep max (1RM) can be tested.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

While not explicitly detailed in the JSON, those experiencing stalls may consider slight alterations in rest intervals, refining technique, or reassessing nutritional and recovery strategies.

## Example Application

For a 185 lbs male focusing on the bench press, an example week might look like:

- **Monday:** 6x6@220 lbs
- **Wednesday:** 7x5@235 lbs
- **Friday:** 8x4@250 lbs
- **Saturday:** 10x3@265 lbs

Progress by increasing the weight by 5-10 lbs each week following this volume pattern.

## Important Notes

The Smolov Jr. program is high in volume and requires substantial recovery, making it advisable to prioritize sleep, nutrition, and possibly reduce other physical activities. This specialization program is typically applied to either the squat or bench press due to its taxing nature.

## Volume Metrics

Weekly training volume is extensive. For example, one week might involve: 6x6 + 7x5 + 8x4 + 10x3 = 154 reps.

## Summary

The Smolov Jr. 3-Week High Volume Blast is a short-term, intense specialization program perfect for lifters looking to make significant gains in either the squat or bench press. Designed for intermediate to advanced lifters, it demands strict adherence to recovery to ensure successful execution and optimal results. After completing the cycle, lifters are expected to achieve new personal records in their focused lift.
