## Overview and Execution

The Bear Routine is executed by completing five sets of five repetitions at approximately 80% of your 1RM, with rest intervals of 2-3 minutes between sets. After completing these heavy sets, reduce the weight by 10-15% and perform another five sets of five repetitions, this time with only 1 minute of rest between sets. The goal is to maintain form throughout both segments of the routine.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you find yourself stalling or unable to complete the prescribed sets and reps, consider reducing the weight slightly and refocusing on maintaining perfect form. Ensure enough rest and recovery between sessions, and listen to your body for signs of overreaching.

## Example Application

For the Deadlift, an example session might look like this:

- Perform 5×5 at 315 lbs with 2 minutes rest between sets.
- Reduce the weight to 280 lbs and perform an additional 5×5, this time with only 1 minute rest between sets.

If these sets are successfully completed with good form, increase the weight in the following session.

## Important Notes

- This program involves high volume, which is effective for increasing both strength and size.
- Accumulation of fatigue is a risk, so monitor closely for signs of overtraining.
- Typically used for one main lift per session; plan accordingly to manage workload.

## Volume Metrics

The volume for this routine is structured as 10 sets of 5 reps, culminating in a total of 50 reps per training session.

## Summary

The Bear Routine is a high-volume program devised to enhance both strength and muscle size, suitable for intermediate to advanced trainees. Its structure demands attentiveness to recovery and management of fatigue, making it crucial to monitor progress and adjust as needed. This routine shines in its simplicity and effectiveness, particularly when employed on compound lifts within a 4-6 week cycle.
