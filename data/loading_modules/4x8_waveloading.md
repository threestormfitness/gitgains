## Overview and Execution

The 4×8 Wave Loading module is executed over 3-6 weeks, consisting of 2 waves per session. Each session begins with Wave 1: performing 2 sets of 8 repetitions at approximately 70% of your 1RM (one-repetition maximum). Following this, Wave 2 involves increasing the load to 75-80% of your 1RM and completing another 2 sets of 8 reps. Each session, aim to increment the second wave's weight if the first wave feels manageable. This module utilizes a slight progressive overload to encourage muscle adaptation without overtraining.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

While the program doesn't explicitly address stalling, it's implied that autoregulation allows for progression. Observe your performance; if stalling occurs, ensure adequate recovery and possibly extend rest intervals or decrease intensity slightly.

## Example Application

Consider an intermediate male trainee weighing 185 lbs:

- **Session 1**
  - Wave 1: 100 lbs × 8 reps, 100 lbs × 8 reps
  - Wave 2: 105 lbs × 8 reps, 110 lbs × 8 reps

For subsequent sessions, attempt to increase the load used in Wave 2. If 110 lbs is manageable, try progressing to 115 lbs during Wave 2 in the next session.

## Important Notes

- The approach favors compound or large isolation movements to maximize effectiveness.
- Keep rest intervals around 2 minutes to maintain form across sets.
- This method focuses on small increments to support progressive overload safely.

## Volume Metrics

The program consists of 4 sets of 8 reps per session, totaling 32 reps.

## Summary

The 4×8 Wave Loading module is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters aiming to increase strength through controlled, progressive overload in short cycles. By alternating intensity in waves, the program maximizes muscle recruitment while allowing lifters to autoregulate and adapt to the load incrementally. This method is particularly beneficial for those looking to improve strength in compound movements without reaching failure.
