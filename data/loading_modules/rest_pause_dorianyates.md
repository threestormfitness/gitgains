## Overview and Execution

The Rest-Pause module, inspired by Dorian Yates, is characterized by high intensity and low volume. You should use a heavy weight that allows you to perform 6-8 reps to failure. Once you reach failure, rack the weight and rest for approximately 15 seconds. Subsequently, perform as many additional reps as possible. Repeat this mini-rest-pause process for 1-2 segments, totaling 1 all-out set per exercise. The focus is on controlled negatives and progressing as your strength allows.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

For advanced trainees utilizing this module, dealing with plateaus involves ensuring adequate recovery and potentially reducing intensity or volume. Incorporating a deload week at the end of the 4-6 week cycle can aid recovery and break plateaus.

## Example Application

- **Incline Press Example:**
  - **Initial Set**: 8 reps to failure with 200 lbs
  - **Mini-Rest**: Rack the weight, rest 15 seconds
  - **First Mini-Burst**: Perform 3 additional reps
  - **Mini-Rest**: Rack the weight, rest another 15 seconds
  - **Second Mini-Burst**: Perform 2 additional reps
  - Total workout for incline press is complete when the exercise sequence is done.

## Important Notes

- This program is extremely intense and is not suitable for beginners.
- It requires training to failure, meaning every mini-burst should push your limits.
- The program is designed for low volume but high effort, making it suitable for advanced hypertrophy phases.
- Deload or substantial recovery periods are advisable after completing a 4-6 week cycle.

## Volume Metrics

Each main set typically consists of 2-3 mini-bursts, resulting in a total of approximately 12-15 reps per exercise.

## Summary

The Rest-Pause module, inspired by Dorian Yates, is a high-intensity, low-volume training program designed for advanced lifters looking to increase hypertrophy. It is based on pushing to failure, utilizing mini-rest segments for additional reps. The program is ideal for muscle growth and strength adaptation but should be approached with caution due to its intensity. A deload is recommended after the program cycle to prevent overtraining and facilitate recovery.
