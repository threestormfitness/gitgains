## Overview and Execution

**Concept**  
The Pendulum Wave Approach “swings” through different rep schemes from week to week (e.g., 7-5-3, then 5-3-1, then 3-2-1, etc.). This frequent variation helps stimulate strength and hypertrophy by preventing the body from over-adapting to a single rep range.

**Execution Basics**

- Each “wave” (e.g., 7-5-3) usually involves three working sets performed in ascending weight order. For instance:
    - Set 1: 7 reps (moderate load)
    - Set 2: 5 reps (heavier load)
    - Set 3: 3 reps (heaviest load)
- In the following week, you switch to a different wave scheme (e.g., 5-3-1).
- Keep rest intervals between 90–180 seconds, adjusting based on how you recover.
- Strive to add weight each set while still maintaining good form and an RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) that doesn’t lead to frequent failures.

**Rationale**

- By consistently altering the rep range, you’ll challenge different muscle fiber types and energy systems.
- This can be especially beneficial for intermediate to advanced lifters who find that sticking to one rep range for too long leads to stagnation or boredom.
- Tracking loads for each scheme from cycle to cycle is essential for progressive overload.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

Although this protocol is designed to reduce staleness via weekly variation, you might still encounter plateaus. Some potential strategies include:

- **Adjust Your Starting Loads**: If you stall mid-wave, reduce the load for the next session so you can complete the prescribed reps.
- **Add a Deload Week**: Even though this module doesn’t explicitly schedule a deload, you can introduce a lighter, lower-volume week if you feel excessively fatigued.
- **Focus on Technique**: Video your lifts to ensure technical proficiency, as poor form can contribute to stalled progress.

## Example Application

Below is a hypothetical 6-week layout for a 185 lb intermediate-to-advanced male lifter. Assume this is for the squat, though you can apply the same logic to other main lifts (bench, deadlift, etc.). The first number in each wave represents the highest rep target (lighter set) and the final number is the lowest rep target (heaviest set).

**Week 1 (7-5-3)**

- Set 1: 7 reps @ ~225 lbs
- Set 2: 5 reps @ ~245 lbs
- Set 3: 3 reps @ ~265 lbs
- (Increase or maintain loads over subsequent sessions if you feel strong, ensuring you hit all prescribed reps.)

**Week 2 (5-3-1)**

- Set 1: 5 reps @ ~235 lbs
- Set 2: 3 reps @ ~255 lbs
- Set 3: 1 rep @ ~275–285 lbs

**Week 3 (3-2-1)**

- Set 1: 3 reps @ ~245 lbs
- Set 2: 2 reps @ ~265 lbs
- Set 3: 1 rep @ ~285–295 lbs

**Week 4 (6-4-2)**

- Set 1: 6 reps @ ~235 lbs
- Set 2: 4 reps @ ~255 lbs
- Set 3: 2 reps @ ~275 lbs

**Week 5 (3-2-1)**

- Repeat the same structure as Week 3, but aim to add 5–10 lbs if able.

**Week 6 (2-2-1)**

- Set 1: 2 reps @ ~275 lbs
- Set 2: 2 reps @ ~285 lbs
- Set 3: 1 rep @ ~300+ lbs (if strong enough)

_Note:_ The loads above are examples and should be adjusted to the individual’s capacity and progress.

## Important Notes

- **Frequent Variation Avoids Plateaus**: Changing rep schemes weekly provides fresh stimuli for both neuromuscular adaptation and hypertrophy.
- **Progress Conservatively**: Each weekly wave is performed similarly—start with a manageable weight and increase each set if you’re hitting the target reps.
- **Autoregulation**: If a certain day feels off, reduce load slightly or repeat the previous week’s weights instead of forcing progression.

---

## Volume Metrics

- **“Varies Each Week”**: Because each wave scheme involves different rep counts, weekly volume will fluctuate.
- You can calculate total volume per workout by summing `(sets × reps × load)`. Track this over time to see how changes in rep schemes influence overall volume.

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s Pendulum Wave Approach is a 6-week rotating wave scheme that provides variety in rep ranges each week. This method particularly benefits intermediate to advanced trainees who grow stale with a single rep range or plateau frequently. By “swinging” rep targets (7-5-3 one week, 5-3-1 the next, etc.), the lifter hits multiple strength and hypertrophy stimuli, maintains engagement, and can push for progressive overload across each wave.

If you value frequent changes in set/rep prescriptions and want to avoid stagnation, this approach may be an excellent fit.
