## Overview and Execution

Wave Loading with Autoregulation typically runs in cycles of decreasing reps (e.g., 6–4–2) while increasing weight each set. Once you finish a “wave,” you start the next wave at a slightly higher weight—provided your RPE targets align.

- **Wave 1**: 6 reps (RPE 7), 4 reps (RPE 8), 2 reps (RPE 9).
- **Wave 2**: Increase weight if the first wave felt manageable; keep RPE 7–9 in each set.
- **Stop** if RPE jumps too high or your technique falters.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: If waves become too challenging, reduce top-end intensity or skip the final 2-rep portion.
- **Accumulation**: Focus on more volume in the 6-rep range for a few sessions before returning to heavier waves.

## Example Application

For an intermediate 185 lb lifter with a ~315 lb squat max:

- **Wave 1**:
    - 6 reps @ 225 lb (RPE 7),
    - 4 reps @ 245 lb (RPE 8),
    - 2 reps @ 265 lb (RPE 9).
- **Wave 2**: Increase each step by 5 lb if the first wave was comfortable.
- **Next Weeks**: Keep adding small increments when RPE stays below targets; reduce if you overshoot.

## Important Notes

- RPE-based wave loading requires honesty in rating how difficult each set is.
- Each wave is meant to push slightly beyond the previous wave’s load if your readiness is good.

## Volume Metrics

A two-wave session typically yields 24 total reps (6+4+2 × 2). You can do more or fewer waves depending on time and recovery.

## Summary

Wave Loading with Autoregulation hits multiple intensity zones within one session, fostering both strength and hypertrophy. It is best suited for intermediate to advanced lifters who can manage heavier sets at varying rep ranges and properly gauge RPE.
