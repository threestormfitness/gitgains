### Overview and Execution

Perform an “activation set” of 12–20 reps near failure. Rest ~20 seconds, then do a mini-set of 3–5 reps. Rest another 20 seconds, continue with 3–5 reps, and repeat until you can’t complete at least 3 reps. Increase weight 2.5–5 lbs when you easily reach the upper end of your total rep range (e.g., 20–25 combined reps).

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you stop seeing progression, switch exercises or adjust the rep range (e.g., do 10–15 reps or 15–20 reps).
- Alternatively, reduce load by 5–10% and rebuild volume.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** using Leg Press:

- Start with 250 lbs for ~15 reps, rest 20s, then 4 reps, rest 20s, 4 reps, rest 20s, 3 reps… until you can’t get 3.
- If you exceed 20 total reps, move up to 260 lbs next session.
- If you fail to get a quality activation set, reduce to 240 lbs.

### Important Notes

- Works well with machines or safe free-weight movements (like a Smith machine).
- The short rests maximize muscle fiber recruitment without heavy overall fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**. Typically 1 activation set plus 2–4 mini-sets of 3–5 reps.

### Summary

Myo-Reps target high muscle fiber recruitment via brief rest intervals and repeated near-failure efforts. It’s popular for hypertrophy and time-efficiency in moderate rep ranges.
