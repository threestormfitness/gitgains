| Field                          | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

### Overview and Execution

Perform a static hold in the most demanding range (e.g., halfway up) for 10–15 seconds. Drop the weight by 10–20% and do full-range reps to failure, then drop another 10–20% and finish with one more static hold. Rest 1–2 minutes if you repeat the sequence. Increase either the hold time (by ~5 seconds each week) or the initial load once you adapt.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If progress stalls, add partial reps after each static hold.
- You can also slightly reduce hold times if you can’t complete the dynamic reps adequately.

### Example Application

- **Week 1 (Shoulder Press)**:
    - Hold 50 lb dumbbells halfway for 10 seconds.
    - Drop to 40 lb and do reps to failure.
    - Drop to 30 lb and hold static until you can’t.
- **Week 2**:
    - Extend the first hold to 15 seconds or add 5 lb to the initial weight.

### Important Notes

Focus on proper body alignment during holds. Because you’re taxing the muscle in both static and dynamic fashions, expect a high level of fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

Each full sequence has 3 parts (static → dynamic → static). You might do 2–3 sequences total, depending on your broader program.

### Summary

Static-Dynamic Drop Sets are excellent for pushing through sticking points by combining isometric strength with dynamic reps. Suitable for intermediate to advanced lifters looking for a unique way to overload muscles.
