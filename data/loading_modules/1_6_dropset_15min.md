### Overview and Execution

You’ll pair a heavy single (around 90–92% of 1RM) with a reduced-weight set of 6 reps (around 80–85% of 1RM). Rest 2–3 minutes between the single and the 6-rep set, then another 2–3 minutes before repeating. Complete 3 total cycles. Once you can finish all three cycles without form breakdown or missed reps, add 2.5–5 lb next session.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you miss reps at the 6-rep mark, slightly reduce your 6-rep load or add short “cluster” breaks (10–15 seconds) within the set.
- If the single feels unsteady or too heavy, lower it to ~85% for a while, then build back up.

### Example Application

For an intermediate lifter who benches ~250 lb for 1RM:

- **Week 1**:
    - 1 rep at 225 lb (90% of 1RM), rest 3 minutes
    - 6 reps at 200 lb (80%), rest 3 minutes, repeat for 3 cycles
- **Week 2**:
    - If it was successful (all reps completed), add 5 lb to each weight (e.g., single at 230, 6 reps at 205).

### Important Notes

This approach is somewhat advanced—ensure you’re comfortable handling near-max loads. Keep strict rest intervals to maintain performance consistency.

### Volume Metrics

Each session typically involves 6 working sets: 3 heavy singles + 3 sets of 6.

### Summary

The 1-6 Drop Set blends a near-maximal single to recruit high-threshold motor units, followed by a moderate-heavy set of 6 to capitalize on the heightened neural drive. Ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters looking to bridge strength and hypertrophy goals.
