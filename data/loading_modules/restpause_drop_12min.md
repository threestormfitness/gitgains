### Overview and Execution

Select a weight for ~8 reps to failure. After reaching failure, rest 15 seconds (rest-pause), drop weight by 10–15%, and do another AMRAP set to failure. Rest 15 seconds again, drop another 10–15%, and do a final set to failure. Increase your starting weight when you can exceed 10 reps on the first set.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- Insert a deload week if you continuously fail to progress or feel overly taxed. Reduce the top weight by ~10–20%.
- Adjust the drop percentages if you’re hitting too few reps after each drop.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** on dumbbell shoulder press:

- Start at 60 lb dumbbells for 8 reps to failure, rest 15s, drop to 50 lb dumbbells, do AMRAP, rest 15s, drop to 40 lb, AMRAP.
- If you hit 10 reps initially, move to 65 lb dumbbells next time.
- Deload to 55 lb if you stall for multiple sessions.

### Important Notes

- This method is very taxing. Make sure to limit usage to 1–2 exercises per session.
- Be mindful of form under fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**. Typically 1 extended drop set with 2–3 total drops, each to failure.

### Summary

Combining rest-pause with drop sets brings extreme intensity for hypertrophy. Best for advanced bodybuilders looking to push a muscle group to its limit, but requires careful volume management.
