## 3-2-1 Wave Loading

### Overview
The 3-2-1 wave loading scheme targets near-maximal strength with lower reps, emphasizing neural adaptation (improved motor unit recruitment) over hypertrophy. It’s ideal for short, intense strength blocks.

### Structure
- **Wave 1**  
  1. Set 1: 3 reps  
  2. Set 2: 2 reps  
  3. Set 3: 1 rep (heaviest of the wave)
- **Wave 2 (and possibly Wave 3)**  
  1. Set 4: 3 reps (slightly heavier than Wave 1’s 3-rep set)  
  2. Set 5: 2 reps (heavier than Wave 1’s 2-rep set)  
  3. Set 6: 1 rep (heavier than Wave 1’s 1-rep set)

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Keep the first wave conservative so you can increase the load in subsequent waves.  
- The single rep in each wave “primes” the nervous system to lift heavier on the next wave.  
- Auto-regulate: continue doing waves only if you can still add weight without failing the prescribed reps.

### Rest Intervals
- Aim for 90–120 seconds to maximize the post-tetanic potentiation effect, but up to 3 minutes if needed for heavier lifts.  
- Rest slightly longer on the 1-rep set if you feel excessively fatigued.

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Best for experienced lifters who can handle near-maximal loads safely.  
- Improves 1RM strength quickly but may not stimulate much hypertrophy.  
- Typically used in shorter training cycles (2–3 weeks) because of the heavy loads.

### Summary
3-2-1 waves deliver rapid strength gains via high neurological demands. The single-rep sets drive neural excitation, helping you lift heavier in subsequent waves. Use for brief periods to peak strength, and ensure you’re recovered enough between sets.
