## 5-3-1 Wave Loading

### Overview
The 5-3-1 wave loading scheme is a popular balance of strength and hypertrophy, leaning strongly toward neurological adaptations. It involves three distinct rep targets that progressively ramp up the load and is effective for building a solid strength base.

### Structure
- **Wave 1**  
  1. Set 1: 5 reps (moderate load)  
  2. Set 2: 3 reps (increase load)  
  3. Set 3: 1 rep (further increase load)
- **Wave 2 (and Wave 3 if appropriate)**  
  1. Set 4: 5 reps (heavier than Wave 1’s 5-rep set)  
  2. Set 5: 3 reps (heavier than Wave 1’s 3-rep set)  
  3. Set 6: 1 rep (heavier than Wave 1’s 1-rep set)

You can perform 2–3 waves with this scheme.

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Start Wave 1 conservatively to avoid early fatigue.  
- For Wave 2, your 5-rep load will be around what you used for 3 reps in the first wave. Increase again for the 3-rep and 1-rep sets.  
- Aim for progressive overload without grinding or breaking form.

### Rest Intervals
- 90–180 seconds is recommended.  
- Adjust upward if you feel you need more recovery, especially before the 1-rep set.

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Great for intermediate to advanced lifters focusing on maximizing strength while still getting some hypertrophy.  
- Watch for overreaching if attempting a third wave. Prioritize form and speed on heavy singles.

### Summary
5-3-1 wave loading is highly effective for building overall strength, with enough volume on the 5-rep sets for moderate hypertrophy. The 1-rep sets drive neurological gains, and repeated waves let you incrementally surpass previous loads.
