## Overview and Execution

The Hepburn Method Power Progression is designed to gradually build strength using heavy loads. The trainee selects a weight that's approximately 90% of their one-rep max (1RM) for their chosen big barbell lift. The program starts with 8 sets of 2 reps (8×2). In each subsequent session, the goal is to add one rep to a different set until reaching 8 sets of 3 reps (8×3). Once 8×3 is achieved, increase the weight by approximately 5-10 pounds and begin again at 8×2. This approach allows for slow, steady progression and reduces the risk of overtraining.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If progress stalls or you fail to increase reps over multiple sessions, consider reducing volume or intensity slightly, or incorporating a deload week. Autoregulate progress and avoid forcing reps; let progress come naturally.

## Example Application

For an intermediate to advanced trainee with a bench press 1RM of 333 lbs:

- Start at 300 lbs for 8×2.
- Next session, attempt 7×2 and 1×3 @ 300 lbs.
- Over several sessions, build up to 8×3 @ 300 lbs.
- Once 8×3 is achieved, increase the weight to 310 lbs and revert to 8×2.

## Important Notes

- The focus is on a slow and steady increase in strength without pushing to failure.
- This module is typically combined with lighter accessory exercises (e.g., 3×6-8) to round out the training session.
- It's crucial not to force additional reps if you're not ready; listen to your body and progress when it feels right.

## Volume Metrics

The training volume starts at 16 total reps per session (8×2) and increases to 24 reps per session (8×3).

## Summary

The Hepburn Method Power Progression is ideal for lifters aiming to advance their strength in big barbell movements with a conservative and effective strategy, balancing heavy lifting with manageable volume. Designed for intermediate and advanced trainees, it facilitates strength gains while reducing the risk of overtraining by emphasizing steady, autoregulated progress.
