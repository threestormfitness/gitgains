  "overview_and_execution": "Wave 1 uses sets of 10, wave 2 uses 8, wave 3 uses 5, wave 4 uses 3. Each wave is ~3-4 weeks. The final set each week is an AMRAP. Performance on AMRAP adjusts your training max for next wave.",
  "example_application": "Wave 1 (10s): Wk1 60%, Wk2 65%, Wk3 70%, each finishing with AMRAP. Then wave 2 (8s) at higher %.",
  "important_notes": "Complex but effective periodization bridging volume & intensity. Great for intermediate lifters needing structured progress.",
  "volume_metrics": "Each wave: 3 weeks of build + 1 deload. Main sets vary from ~3-5 sets plus 1 AMRAP."
