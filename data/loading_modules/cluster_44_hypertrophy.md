## Overview and Execution

To perform the Hypertrophy Cluster module, use approximately 80% of your 1RM. For each cluster set, execute one rep, rest for 10 seconds, then perform another rep. Repeat this process until four reps are completed, making one cluster set. Perform a total of four cluster sets with a rest of approximately two minutes between each set. This approach allows partial recovery between individual reps, facilitating the use of heavier weights than typical 4×4 protocols.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This module does not specifically address plateau strategies; however, given the autoregulated nature of this training, lifters should adjust weights or modify rest periods if stalling occurs.

## Example Application

An example of applying this module could be as follows:

- **Exercise**: Bench Press
- **Load**: 80% of 1RM

Session:

1. Set 1:  
   - Perform 1 rep  
   - Rest for 10 seconds  
   - Repeat until 4 reps are completed  

   Rest for 2 minutes

2. Repeat the sequence to complete 4 total cluster sets.

This procedure assumes an intermediate trainer weighing approximately 185 lbs.

## Important Notes

- This training module allows for greater loads than standard 4×4 due to the brief rests, promoting strength and hypertrophy synergy.
- Ensure you do not train to failure and keep one rep in reserve for optimal results.

## Volume Metrics

Each session consists of four cluster sets with four reps per set, totaling 16 reps at a heavier load.

## Summary

The Hypertrophy Clusters module is designed for intermediate to advanced lifters seeking to maximize strength and hypertrophy through strategic rest intervals that facilitate heavier lifting. By implementing autoregulation, the module ensures flexibility in training adjustments, making it an effective tool for pushing past traditional lifting boundaries.
