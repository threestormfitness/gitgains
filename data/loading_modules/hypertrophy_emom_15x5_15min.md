### Overview and Execution

Set a 15-minute timer. Each minute, perform **5 reps** at **50–60%** of your 1RM, then rest until the next minute starts. This is higher-volume, moderate-intensity work, ideal for hypertrophy and building work capacity. If 15 total sets is too demanding, begin with fewer (10 or 12) and add sets each session.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you can’t complete 5 reps by the final sets, lower the weight 5% or reduce the total minutes to 10 or 12 for a period.
- Once you can do 15 x 5 comfortably, add 2.5–5 lb and repeat the process.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 10 minutes at 115 lb (5 reps/min) = 10 sets total.
- **Week 2**: 12 minutes at 115 lb, still 5 reps each minute.
- **Week 3**: 15 minutes at 115 lb = 75 reps. If successful, next session is 120 lb starting at 10 minutes again.

### Important Notes

- Expect significant fatigue near the end. Focus on consistent technique and tempo.
- Keep your rest strict—start each set exactly when the minute begins.

### Volume Metrics

- **15 sets × 5 reps** = 75 total reps.

### Summary

Designed primarily for hypertrophy and muscular endurance, this EMOM’s fairly high volume at moderate intensity helps new-to-intermediate lifters build size and conditioning. Adjust the total time or load to manage fatigue and progress steadily.
