### Overview and Execution

Perform **1–2 reps on the minute** for 20 minutes straight, using **70–80%** of your 1RM. This extended EMOM builds both skill under load and total volume. If 20 sets is overwhelming, reduce to 15 sets and build up.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail to maintain form or can’t complete the full 20 sets, scale back to 15 sets or drop the weight by 5%.
- Gradually add small weight increments or transition from 1 rep to 2 reps if it becomes too easy.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 20 x 1 at 185 lb for a total of 20 reps.
- **Week 2**: If sets remain strong, attempt 20 x 2 at 185 lb = 40 total reps.
- **Week 3**: If technique still holds, add 5 lb and repeat 20 x 1 or 2 as appropriate.

### Important Notes

- Stay mindful of fatigue over such a long series of sets; maintain consistent technique.
- If time or stamina is limited, use a 15-minute version first.

### Volume Metrics

- **20 sets × 1–2 reps** = **20–40 total reps** per session.

### Summary

A longer EMOM module suitable for lifters aiming to improve work capacity and technique under moderate loads. It can be adjusted easily by changing the total sets (time) or reps, making it useful for building confidence with a moderately heavy weight over many sets.
