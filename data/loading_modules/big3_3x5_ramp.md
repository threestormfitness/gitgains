## Overview and Execution

The Big 3 Ramp 3x5 module focuses on three main lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. The program consists of three ascending ("ramped") sets of 5 reps each. The intensities are roughly 70%, 80%, and 90% of your one-rep max (1RM) for each respective set. The goal is to successfully complete all reps at the top intensity set; if achieved, you should increase the weights slightly in the next session. This approach allows for steady progression without excessive volume. Rest intervals of 2-3 minutes between sets are recommended.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This module emphasizes gradual progress through slight weight increases. If you consistently miss reps in the top set, consider extending the time before attempting heavier weights, ensuring adequate recovery between sessions. Alternatively, a brief deload phase can help break through plateaus.

## Example Application

Consider the bench press using this module:

- Session 1:  
  1. 185×5  
  2. 205×5  
  3. 225×5  

- Session 2 (next time):  
  1. 190×5  
  2. 210×5  
  3. 230×5  

This illustration assumes successful completion of each top set, triggering incremental weight increases in subsequent sessions. Continue this pattern, customizing load increases based on performance.

## Important Notes

- This straightforward ramped set approach is widely utilized in many strength training programs.
- Maintain rest periods between 2-3 minutes to optimize recovery.
- The module supports quick progression without excessive volume, making it ideal for trainees with time constraints.

## Volume Metrics

- Total volume per session: 3 sets × 5 reps = 15 total reps

## Summary

The Big 3 Ramp 3x5 is a versatile strength module suitable for lifters looking to enhance the squat, bench press, and deadlift. It is particularly useful for intermediate to advanced trainees aiming for progressive overload without extensive volume. Its autoregulated nature allows for adaptable progression based on performance, making it a practical choice for those familiar with their 1RM values in the big lifts.
