  "overview_and_execution": "Use the same weight but shift your body or limb position to a stronger mechanical advantage after failing the weaker variation. Typically 2-3 shifts in one set.",
  "example_application": "Shoulder trifecta: Start with standing lateral raise to failure, then partial side raises (top half) to failure, then upright row with same DB to failure.",
  "important_notes": "Great for advanced hypertrophy. Minimizes setup changes. Keep each shift safe and maintain form.",
