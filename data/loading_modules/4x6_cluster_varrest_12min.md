### Overview and Execution

Use ~75% of your 1RM. Each set is broken into mini-clusters: do 2 reps, rest 10 seconds, 2 reps, rest 20 seconds, then 2 reps (total 6 reps per set). Rest 2–3 minutes between sets. Complete 4 sets. Increase weight 2.5–5 lbs once you can comfortably finish all 6 reps in each set.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If 10s/20s rests are insufficient, add a few seconds of rest or reduce the load temporarily.
- Progress in small increments to avoid burnout.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a 225 lb bent-over row 1RM:

- Start at ~170 lbs (75%).
- Perform 2 reps, rest 10s, 2 reps, rest 20s, 2 reps (1 set). Rest 2 min. Repeat 4 times.
- If all sets are completed smoothly, try 175 lbs next session.

### Important Notes

- This approach balances moderate intensity with short intra-set rests to maintain form.
- Great for hypertrophy or strength-endurance without excessive loads.

### Volume Metrics

- **4 sets × 6 reps = 24 total reps** at moderate intensity.

### Summary

A 4×6 cluster approach with variable rest helps maintain quality reps throughout each set. Ideal for lifters wanting a middle ground between pure strength work and classic hypertrophy volumes.
