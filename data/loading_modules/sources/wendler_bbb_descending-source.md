# Boring But Big (Descending)

## Overview
The **Boring But Big (BBB) Descending** module is a structured assistance volume protocol designed to build muscular endurance, hypertrophy, and work capacity after completing a heavier main movement. It consists of **5 sets of 10 reps**, performed at progressively lighter loads each set. This approach allows for high volume while managing fatigue, ensuring quality reps throughout.

## Structure
Perform 5 sets of 10 reps using a descending weight scheme. The percentages are based on your Training Max (TM):

1. **Set 1** – 70% of TM
2. **Set 2** – 60% of TM
3. **Set 3** – 50% of TM
4. **Set 4** – 40% of TM
5. **Set 5** – 30% of TM

## Load Selection Guidelines
- Start with **70% of your Training Max** for the first set.
- Decrease the load by **~10% per set** to allow for sustainable volume.
- Adjust loads based on performance and fatigue, but avoid excessive reductions.
- Beginners or those new to high-volume training should **start lighter** (e.g., 50%-30% TM).
- The goal is to complete all **50 total reps with solid form** rather than grind through excessive fatigue.

## Rest Intervals
- **60-90 seconds** between sets for hypertrophy focus.
- **90-120 seconds** if using heavier loads or struggling with fatigue.
- Supersetting with **pulling movements (e.g., chin-ups, rows)** can be an efficient way to manage time while maintaining balance in the program.

## Execution / Key Considerations
- The descending structure helps **maintain bar speed and rep quality** as fatigue sets in.
- This method is useful for **lifters who struggle with fatigue accumulation** using straight sets at the same weight.
- Works well as a **secondary movement** after a primary strength-focused lift (e.g., doing BBB Descending squats after heavy back squats).
- **Substitutions**: Can use variations of the main lift (e.g., front squats instead of back squats, trap bar deadlifts instead of conventional).
- If **grip fatigue** is an issue on deadlifts, **straps can be used**.

## Progression Model
### Option 1: Linear Load Increase
- **Week 1**: 70/60/50/40/30% TM
- **Week 2**: 75/65/55/45/35% TM
- **Week 3**: 80/70/60/50/40% TM
- **Week 4**: Deload (3x10 at 50% TM or skip assistance volume)

### Option 2: Rotating Weights (Wave Progression)
- **Cycle 1**: Use a light weight (e.g., 50-30% TM)
- **Cycle 2**: Increase by ~5% per set (e.g., 55-35% TM)
- **Cycle 3**: Increase further (e.g., 60-40% TM)
- Once at **70-30% TM**, start over but with a slightly higher Training Max.

## Summary
The **Boring But Big (Descending)** module is a structured, fatigue-managed approach to high-volume assistance work. By decreasing the load each set, lifters can maintain **higher rep quality**, **reduce excessive fatigue**, and **sustain long-term progress** without burning out. This method is particularly effective for **hypertrophy**, **work capacity building**, and **technical reinforcement** of a lift under moderate fatigue.
