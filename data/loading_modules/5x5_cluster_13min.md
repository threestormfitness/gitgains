### Overview and Execution

Select a load for which you could manage ~6–7 reps in a straight set (about 80–85% 1RM). For each of the 5 sets:

1. Perform 2 reps, rest 15 seconds,
2. Perform 2 reps, rest 15 seconds,
3. Perform 1 rep (5 total).  
    Rest 2–3 minutes before starting the next set. Once you can hit all 5 sets consistently, increase the load by 2.5–5 lbs.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- Slightly increase rest (to 20s) within the cluster if you’re missing reps.
- If stalling continues, drop the load ~5–10% and work back up.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a ~265 lb bench press 1RM:

- You might start at ~220 lbs (about 83%).
- Perform: (2 reps, rest 15s, 2 reps, rest 15s, 1 rep) = 1 cluster set. Do 5 of these total.
- If you complete all sets, try 225 lbs next session.

### Important Notes

- Clustering the set into 2-2-1 helps maintain bar speed and form, avoiding the burnout of 5 continuous reps.

### Volume Metrics

- **5 sets × 5 reps = 25 total reps** at a relatively high intensity.

### Summary

This 5×5 cluster variation provides a more manageable approach to heavier 5-rep sets. It’s a solid method for building strength without the sudden fatigue spikes typical of straight-set 5×5 programs.
