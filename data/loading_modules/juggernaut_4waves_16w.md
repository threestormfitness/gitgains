## Overview and Execution

The Juggernaut Method is a program broken down into four waves over 16 weeks, gradually increasing intensity while adjusting volume. Each wave consists of progressive rep ranges: 

- **Wave 1 (10s):** Perform sets of 10 with increasing intensity each week, concluding with an AMRAP (as many reps as possible) in the third week.
- **Wave 2 (8s):** Similar to wave 1 but entails sets of 8.
- **Wave 3 (5s) & 4 (3s):** Follow the same progression model with decreasing reps and increasing loads.

Progression is autoregulated based on performance in the final week's AMRAP, adjusting the training max for the next wave. This method combines volume with intensity for structured progression suited for intermediate lifters.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If progress stalls or plateaus occur, adjust your training max based on AMRAP performance or incorporate additional deloads.

## Example Application

For an intermediate 185 lbs male lifter, the program might run as follows:

### Wave 1 (10s):
- **Week 1:** Work up to 60% 1RM, final set AMRAP.
- **Week 2:** Increase to 65%, final set AMRAP.
- **Week 3:** Increase to 70%, final set AMRAP.

### Wave 2 (8s):
- **Week 4:** Deload week to recover.
- **Week 5:** Begin at 70% with 8s.
- **Week 6:** Increase to 75%, conclude with AMRAP.

This pattern continues with waves 3 and 4, adjusting intensity and reps according to your updated training max calculated from prior AMRAP sets.

## Important Notes

- The Juggernaut Method is a complex but effective periodization strategy, perfect for intermediate lifters who need a structured approach.
- Emphasize technique during AMRAP sets to ensure safety and effectiveness.
- This program bridges the gap between volume-focused and intensity-focused training phases.

## Volume Metrics

- Each wave consists of 3 weeks of build-up followed by a deloading week.
- The main work includes approximately 3-5 sets plus 1 AMRAP, adapting to individual capacity and performance metrics.

## Summary

The Juggernaut Method offers a cycle of waves designed to build strength progressively over a 16-week period. It is optimal for intermediate lifters seeking an organized plan that balances volume and intensity, leveraging autoregulation to address individualized progression. Through strategic use of AMRAP and training max adjustments, this module provides a robust framework for developing foundational lifts such as the squat, bench press, deadlift, and overhead press.
