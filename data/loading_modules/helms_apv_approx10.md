## Overview and Execution

Autoregulatory Progressive Volume has you begin each session with a baseline set count (e.g., 3) at RPE 7. If you complete the baseline without exceeding RPE 7, you add another set. You keep adding sets until RPE 8 is reached.

- **Load Increases**: When you can do all baseline sets at ≤RPE 7, bump up the weight next session.
- This approach adapts session volume to how strong/energetic you feel that day.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: Start at fewer sets if you’re burned out or exceed RPE 8 too soon.
- **Adjust Rep Range**: If stalling, shift from 6–10 reps to a different range for variety.

## Example Application

A 185 lb intermediate focusing on overhead press might do:

- **Week 1**: 3×8 at 115 lb, RPE 7 on all sets, so add a 4th set. If that 4th set hits RPE 8, stop.
- **Next Week**: If 3 sets at 115 lb remain at RPE 7 or below, try 120 lb. If it jumps above RPE 8 quickly, you may drop back to 115 lb or recheck form.

## Important Notes

- Great for hypertrophy or general strength because you self-regulate volume.
- Keep a close eye on RPE ratings—over- or under-estimating can change your volume dramatically.

## Volume Metrics

Volume can vary day to day. Typically 3–5+ sets of 6–10 reps, adjusting as performance dictates.

## Summary

APV dynamically adjusts set count to your daily performance. It ensures you do enough work on “good days” and manage volume on “tough days,” making it ideal for intermediate lifters seeking balanced progress without a strict set prescription.
