### Overview and Execution

Load the bar to ~90% of your 1RM. Perform a single rep, rack the bar, rest ~20–30s, then perform another single. Aim for about 5 singles in one cluster. After a cluster, rest 2–3 minutes and repeat as needed for 2–3 clusters. Increase the load slightly (2.5–5 lbs) when you successfully complete all planned singles with good bar speed.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you can’t finish 5 singles per cluster, reduce the load by 5% or lengthen your rest to ~45s between reps.
- Check technique—near-max loads require pristine form.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a ~400 lb squat 1RM:

- Work at ~360 lbs (90%). Perform 1 rep, rest 30s, repeat until you hit 5 singles.
- Rest 3 min, do a second cluster. If you succeed both clusters, next session try 365 lbs.
- If you fail mid-cluster, reduce to 350 lbs next time or extend rest to 45s.

### Important Notes

- This is best for advanced lifters comfortable handling heavy loads.
- Prioritize neural adaptations and technique over volume.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**. Typically 2–3 clusters of ~5 singles = 10–15 total reps.

### Summary

High-intensity cluster singles at 90% 1RM emphasize maximal strength and technical proficiency under heavy load. Ideal for experienced lifters needing to refine heavy-lift performance.
