### Overview and Execution

Escalating Density Training (EDT) focuses on maximizing the total number of reps performed in a fixed 15-minute window. Choose two exercises that target opposing muscle groups (e.g., pushing and pulling). Use your 10RM load for both movements.

**Execution Steps:**
1. Set a timer for 15 minutes.
2. Alternate between the two exercises, performing up to 5 reps per set.
3. Rest minimally (15-30 seconds) between sets.
4. As fatigue accumulates, reduce reps per set as needed while maintaining good form.
5. Aim to beat your previous session’s total rep count by at least one rep.

---

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you find yourself unable to increase the total reps for 2-3 consecutive sessions, consider the following strategies:
- **Reduce Rest:** Shorten rest intervals between sets.
- **Change Rep Scheme:** Drop to sets of 3 reps, focusing on faster set transitions.
- **Swap Exercises:** Rotate in similar but different exercises to stimulate new adaptations.
- **Deload:** Take a lighter session to recover, then push harder the following week.

---

### Example Application

For an intermediate trainee weighing 185 lbs:

**Session 1:**
- **Exercise 1:** Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press (10RM = 50 lbs)
- **Exercise 2:** Lat Pulldown (10RM = 120 lbs)

- **Minutes 0-5:** Perform 5 reps per set, completing 3-4 sets of each.
- **Minutes 5-10:** Adjust to 4 reps per set, completing 3-4 sets.
- **Minutes 10-15:** Drop to 3 reps per set, completing as many sets as possible.

**Total Reps:**
- Shoulder Press: ~42 reps
- Lat Pulldown: ~42 reps

**Session 2:**
- Aim for at least 43 reps per exercise.

Continue progressing until total reps improve by 20%, then increase the load by 2.5-5%.

---

### Important Notes

- Perform **up to 5 reps per set**, even if capable of more.
- **Adjust reps down** as fatigue sets in, but maintain good form.
- **Rest minimally** between sets (15-30 seconds).
- **Progress by increasing total reps** each session.
- **Increase weight by 2.5-5%** once total reps improve by 20% over the initial session.

---

### Volume Metrics

- Typically **40-50 total reps per exercise** in the 15-minute session.

### Summary

Staley’s EDT 15-Minute PR Zone is an efficient, high-intensity module ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters seeking strength and hypertrophy gains. By focusing on density rather than just load, it fosters progressive overload and mental toughness. The module’s autoregulated nature makes it adaptable, while its simplicity makes it easy to integrate into various training programs.
