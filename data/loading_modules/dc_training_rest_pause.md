## Overview and Execution

DC Training, also known as Doggcrapp, employs a high-intensity rest-pause method to stimulate hypertrophy. To perform this module, select a weight at which you can reach failure in 6-8 reps. Begin with lifting until failure, rack the weight, rest for 10-15 seconds, then lift again to failure. Repeat this process for a total of 3 mini-sets, aiming to reach the target of 11-15 reps across all mini-sets. Over time, you should aim to increase either the weight or the total reps completed to continue progression.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

Should progress stall, consider deloading by transitioning to a cruise period after 6-8 weeks. During this time, reduce the intensity and volume to allow for recovery before returning to another blast phase.

## Example Application

### Week 1
- **Exercise**: Incline Dumbbell Press
  - **Session 1**:  
    - 1st mini-set: 8 reps  
    - Rest: 15 seconds  
    - 2nd mini-set: 3 reps  
    - Rest: 15 seconds  
    - 3rd mini-set: 2 reps  
    - Total: 13 reps

### Week 2 Progression
- **Exercise**: Incline Dumbbell Press
  - **Session 2**:  
    - 1st mini-set: 8 reps  
    - Rest: 15 seconds  
    - 2nd mini-set: 4 reps  
    - Rest: 15 seconds  
    - 3rd mini-set: 3 reps  
    - Total: 15 reps (increase weight next session)

## Important Notes

This program is high-intensity and is characterized by minimal exercise selection—typically one exercise per body part per session. It’s crucial to apply extreme stretches after your sets to enhance muscle flexibility and recovery. Be cautious to balance intensity with sufficient recovery periods to prevent overtraining.

## Volume Metrics

The DC Training module primarily revolves around 1 main rest-pause set per exercise, broken into 3 mini-sets to reach the desired total rep count.

## Summary

DC Training is designed for intermediate to advanced trainees looking to push the limits of muscle hypertrophy through a high-intensity approach. By focusing on a rest-pause method, it promotes significant strength and size gains. The open cycle allows flexibility in programming, with the system being autoregulated to fit the athletes' progressing needs.
