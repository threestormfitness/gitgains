## Overview and Execution

Fatigue-Stop Sets use a moderate intensity (about 70% 1RM) for a few straight sets, then a final AMRAP set stopping at RPE 9:

1. Perform 3 sets of 8 at ~70%.
2. On the 4th set, do as many reps as possible but do **not** go to absolute failure; stop around RPE 9.
3. If you exceed your target by a good margin (e.g., 4+ extra reps), you’ll increase weight next time.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: Drop intensity 5–10% or reduce the rep target for a week if your AMRAP set stagnates or becomes too hard.
- **Vary Rep Ranges**: Switch from 8s to 6s while keeping the same method.

## Example Application

For a 185 lb lifter with a ~365 lb squat 1RM (70% ~255 lb):

- **Week 1**: 3×8 @ 255 lb, then final AMRAP set. If you hit 12 reps on that last set, note it.
- **Week 2**: If you consistently get 10+ reps on the final set, move to 260 lb.
- **Week 3**: If you can no longer exceed 8 reps, consider a small deload or rep-range shift.

## Important Notes

- Great for tracking progress because the final AMRAP set acts as a performance indicator.
- Avoid hitting true failure: stopping at RPE 9 helps manage fatigue and recovery.

## Volume Metrics

Typically 4 sets total at 8 reps each, plus potential extra reps on the last set. So roughly 32+ reps.

## Summary

Fatigue-Stop Sets, used in the Juggernaut Method, allow you to gauge progress with a near-to-failure final set. It works well for intermediate lifters aiming to balance volume, intensity, and progression without regularly overreaching.
