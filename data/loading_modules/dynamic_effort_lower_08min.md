## Overview and Execution

To execute this module, perform approximately 8-10 sets of 2 repetitions for squats or deadlifts at 50-70% of your one-repetition maximum (1RM), incorporating bands or chains to add accommodating resistance. The emphasis is on developing speed and explosiveness, with each set being completed as quickly as possible. Rest intervals should be kept short, ranging from 30 to 60 seconds.

The approach is structured in open 3-week waves. For example, within the three weeks, you may start at 50% of your 1RM, increase to 55% in the second week, and culminate at 60% in the third week.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This module does not specifically address plateau or stalling strategies, as it is designed to enhance explosiveness and force development rather than maximal strength gains.

## Example Application

### Sample Program

**Box Squat Cycle:**

- **Week 1**: 10 sets of 2 reps at 50% 1RM plus chains, rest 30-45 seconds between sets.
- **Week 2**: 10 sets of 2 reps at 55% 1RM plus chains, rest 30-45 seconds between sets.
- **Week 3**: 10 sets of 2 reps at 60% 1RM plus chains, rest 30-45 seconds between sets.

This progression targets an intermediate to advanced 185 lbs male trainee, focusing on refining speed and power.

## Important Notes

- The key aim of this module is to enhance the rate of force development. Therefore, it's crucial to maintain submaximal loads while concentrating on explosive execution during each repetition.
- Focus on fast concentric motions, ensuring that the lifts are performed with the intent to move as quickly and forcefully as possible.

## Volume Metrics

This program's primary volume metrics consist of 10 sets × 2 reps, resulting in a total of 20 dynamic repetitions per session.

## Summary

The Dynamic Effort Method for the lower body is a specialized module from Westside Barbell, engineered by Louie Simmons, targeting the enhancement of power and speed in the squat or deadlift. With a focus on submaximal loads and explosive execution, this routine is ideal for intermediate to advanced trainees looking to improve their rate of force development. It fits well into a broader training cycle and can be adapted to different strength protocols, making it a versatile choice for athletes seeking to boost their explosive power.
