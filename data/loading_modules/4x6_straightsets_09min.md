## Overview and Execution

**4×6** targets both strength and hypertrophy. You’ll perform four straight sets of six reps, resting 2–3 minutes between each. If you achieve all 6 reps on all 4 sets, increase the load by 2.5–5 lb next session.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

When you fail to complete 6 reps in at least two sets for **two consecutive sessions**, deload by 5–10% and ramp back up.

## Example Application

An intermediate 185 lb male might run:

- **Week 1**: 4×6 @ 150 lb
- **Week 2**: 4×6 @ 155 lb (if all sets hit 6 reps, continue adding 5 lb)
- **Week 3**: 4×6 @ 160 lb. If at any point he fails to reach 6 reps twice in a row, drop weight to around 145 lb and build back up.

## Important Notes

- Aim for consistent technique and keep rest intervals in the 2–3 minute range.
- Use smaller increments for overhead or isolation movements if needed.

## Volume Metrics

4 sets × 6 reps = 24 total reps.

## Summary

The **4×6** module is ideal for individuals seeking a balance of strength and size. Its moderate rep range encourages solid progression without excessively long workouts.
