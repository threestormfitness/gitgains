### Overview and Execution

This module focuses on maximizing work density within a strict 15-minute window using two antagonistic exercises. Begin with a thorough warm-up and identify your 6RM (six-rep max) load for each exercise. Start a timer for 15 minutes and alternate between the two movements, performing **up to 3 reps per set**. As fatigue builds, drop to 2 or even 1 rep per set, but **never exceed 3 reps**. Rest periods should be minimal—just enough to maintain good form.

The goal is to accumulate as many high-quality reps as possible within the time limit. After completing the session, **record the total reps** for each exercise. This becomes your baseline Personal Record (PR). In subsequent sessions, aim to beat this total by even a single rep. Once you can exceed your initial PR by around **20%**, increase the load by **2.5-5%** and set a new PR target.

---

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you hit a plateau and can't beat your previous PR, here are strategies to break through:

1. **Reduce Rest Periods:** Shorten the time between exercises to increase overall density.
2. **Adjust Rep Scheme:** Alternate between 3-rep clusters and 2-rep clusters to introduce variability.
3. **Modify Exercises:** Slightly change the movement pattern (e.g., from barbell shoulder press to dumbbell press) for a new stimulus.
4. **Wave Loading:** Reduce the weight by 5-10% and aim for a higher total rep count before returning to heavier loads.

### Example Application

**Intermediate Example (185 lbs Male Trainee):**

- **Shoulder Press:** 6RM = 135 lbs
- **Lat Pulldown:** 6RM = 180 lbs

| Minute | Shoulder Press Reps | Lat Pulldown Reps |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1      | 3                   | 3                |
| 2      | 3                   | 3                |
| 3      | 3                   | 3                |
| 4      | 2                   | 3                |
| 5      | 2                   | 2                |
| 6      | 2                   | 2                |

| 8      | 1                   | 2                |
| 9      | 1                   | 1                |
| 10     | 1                   | 1                |
| 11     | 1                   | 1                |
| 12     | 1                   | 1                |
| 13     | 1                   | 1                |
| 14     | 1                   | 1                |
| 15     | 1                   | 1                |

- **Total Shoulder Press Reps:** 26  
- **Total Lat Pulldown Reps:** 30

In the next session, aim to beat these totals by even 1 rep. Once you can consistently exceed these numbers by 20%, increase the weight slightly.

---

### Important Notes

- **Never exceed 3 reps per set.** This keeps fatigue manageable and form consistent.
- **Prioritize form over volume.** As fatigue sets in, adjust reps to maintain proper technique.
- **Exercise selection matters.** Choose simple, safe movements that are easy to perform under fatigue.
- **Minimal rest is key.** Keep rest periods short to maximize density without compromising safety.

---

### Volume Metrics

- **Typical Reps per Exercise:** 24-36 reps over 15 minutes.
- **Total Sets:** Varies depending on how reps are distributed across the session.
- **Load Intensity:** 85-87% of 1RM for both exercises.
