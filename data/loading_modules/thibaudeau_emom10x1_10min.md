### Overview and Execution

Start a timer for 10 minutes. At the top of each minute, perform **1 rep** at about **90% of your 1RM**. Rest for whatever remains of that minute. Because the reps are heavy singles, keep technique and bar speed in check. If you can’t maintain solid form, reduce the load accordingly. Progress by adding a small amount of weight (2.5–5 lb) once you can consistently hit all 10 singles.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail a rep or feel the weight is too heavy to sustain form for all 10 sets, reduce the load by 5–10% at the next session.
- You may also drop the total sets to 8 if 10 is too demanding, then work back to 10 once form is consistent.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 10 x 1 at 200 lb for all sets.
- If successful with no form breakdown, add 5 lb next session.
- **Week 2**: 10 x 1 at 205 lb. If the final rep slows or form deteriorates, repeat 205 lb in the next session before increasing again.

### Important Notes

- Maintain strict form: a single heavy rep can place a lot of stress on the body if performed poorly.
- Keep rest times consistent: each new set starts exactly at the top of the next minute.

### Volume Metrics

- **Total volume**: 10 sets × 1 rep = 10 reps per session.

### Summary

This module suits intermediate or advanced trainees looking to build maximal strength through repeated heavy singles while keeping fatigue manageable. It’s simple, time-efficient, and effective for honing technique under near-maximal loads.
