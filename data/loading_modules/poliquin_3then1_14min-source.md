# 3 Then 1 Method

## Overview
The “3 Then 1” method is a wave-loading approach popularized by Charles Poliquin. It combines a near-maximal triple with a heavier eccentric-only single to stimulate rapid strength gains and functional hypertrophy.

## Structure
1. **Wave Count**: 3 total waves (each wave = one set of 3 + one eccentric-only single).
2. **Set 1 (3 reps)**: Perform 3 reps at a load where the third rep is very challenging but executed with solid form.
3. **Rest**: At least 2 minutes.
4. **Set 2 (1 eccentric-only rep)**: Increase load by at least 10% over the 3-rep set. Perform a single eccentric (negative-only) repetition, lowering the weight under control for 8–10 seconds.
5. **Rest**: At least 2 minutes.
6. **Repeat** for a total of 3 waves, aiming to increase loads slightly each wave if technique allows.

## Load Selection Guidelines
- **Set of 3**: Choose an initial weight that challenges you near your limit for 3 reps.
- **Eccentric-Only Single**: Add at least 10% more weight than your 3-rep set. If you cannot maintain an 8–10 second negative, reduce the load immediately.
- **Progression**: If the eccentric rep is controlled properly, you can often increase weight in subsequent waves due to post-tetanic facilitation.

## Rest Intervals
- **Between Sets**: A minimum of 2 minutes is recommended to recover adequately for the next heavy set.
- **Adjustments**: Longer rest (up to 3–4 minutes) may be used if training with very high loads or if technique deteriorates.

## Execution / Key Considerations
- **Experience Level**: Best suited for intermediate to advanced trainees comfortable with heavy loads and controlling slow negatives.
- **Technique First**: Stop the set immediately if you cannot maintain proper form or the required eccentric duration (8–10 seconds).
- **Goal**: Rapidly build strength and “functional hypertrophy” by combining heavy triples and supramaximal eccentrics.

## Summary
The 3 Then 1 method capitalizes on post-tetanic facilitation, using near-maximal triples and heavy eccentric singles to “excite” the nervous system for greater performance in subsequent waves. It offers a potent stimulus for both strength and size, especially for experienced lifters who can handle intense loading schemes.
