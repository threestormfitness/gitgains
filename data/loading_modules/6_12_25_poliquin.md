## Overview and Execution

The 6-12-25 Method, designed by Charles Poliquin, is an intense hypertrophy program that leverages metabolic stress. To execute this program:

1. **Select Three Exercises:** All exercises should target the same muscle group.
2. **Reps per Exercise:** Start with 6 reps using a heavy load (~80% 1RM), followed by 12 reps with a moderate load (~65% 1RM), and finally 25 reps with a light load (~40-50% 1RM).
3. **Minimal Rest:** Take minimal rest between exercises within the tri-set.
4. **Repeat Tri-set:** Rest 2-3 minutes after completing the tri-set, then repeat the sequence two more times for a total of three tri-sets.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This section can be omitted if the module doesn't address stalling or plateaus.

## Example Application

Here's an example of applying the 6-12-25 Method to a chest workout:

- **Exercise A1:** Dumbbell Bench Press - 6 reps (heavy)
- **Exercise A2:** Incline Press - 12 reps (moderate)
- **Exercise A3:** Cable Fly - 25 reps (light)

Perform the above sequence with minimal rest between exercises and then rest for 2 minutes before repeating the tri-set two more times.

## Important Notes

- This module creates intense metabolic stress, making it particularly effective for short, intense hypertrophy cycles.
- It is specifically designed for single-muscle focus sessions.
- Be cautious and avoid training to absolute failure, except potentially on the last rep of the sequence.

## Volume Metrics

- Each tri-set comprises 43 reps (6 + 12 + 25).
- The full session includes a total of 129 reps (43 reps Ã— 3 tri-sets).

## Summary

The 6-12-25 Method by Charles Poliquin is an effective short-term program aimed at shocking the muscle with high metabolic stress, fostering rapid hypertrophy. This method is best suited for intermediate to advanced lifters due to its intensity and is typically run in cycles lasting 2-4 weeks.
