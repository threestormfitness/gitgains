### Overview and Execution

Start at **70% of 1RM** (or a moderate load) and perform **1–2 reps each minute**. Every 1–2 minutes, increase the weight in small increments (e.g., +2.5–5%) until you reach around **90%**. This “ladder” approach builds up to heavier loads across the 10-minute EMOM.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail at the higher percentages, reduce that top set by 2–3% next time and focus on nailing the rep with excellent form.
- You may stick with the same increments for multiple sessions until you feel comfortable increasing them again.

### Example Application

- **Minutes 1–2**: 70% (2 reps each minute).
- **Minutes 3–4**: 75% (2 reps each minute).
- **Minutes 5–6**: 80% (1–2 reps each minute).
- **Minutes 7–8**: 85%.
- **Minutes 9–10**: ~90%.
- Adjust the rep count if it becomes too strenuous at higher loads (switch from doubles to singles, for example).

### Important Notes

- Pre-plan your jump increments; avoid large jumps if you’re not confident.
- A spotter or safety setup is recommended as you approach heavier loads.

### Volume Metrics

- You will accumulate **10–20 reps** total, depending on if you’re doing singles or doubles.

### Summary

An ascending-weight EMOM effectively warms you up through moderate loads and culminates in near-maximal singles or doubles. This structure suits intermediate lifters seeking to build comfort with heavier loads in a compressed timeframe.
