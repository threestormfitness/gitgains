## Overview and Execution

The PT Pyramid is a bodyweight endurance workout designed to enhance muscular stamina and cardiovascular fitness. You begin at Step 1 with 1 pullup, 2 pushups, and 3 situps. Each subsequent step increases reps proportionally: pullups by 1, pushups by 2, and situps by 3. Continue ascending until Step 10, where you perform 10 pullups, 20 pushups, and 30 situps. After a 1-minute rest at the peak, descend the pyramid in reverse, reducing reps at each step until you return to Step 1.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This module is primarily endurance-based and not designed for progressive overload in the traditional strength sense. However, if you plateau or struggle to complete the full pyramid, consider reducing the top step (e.g., only going to Step 8) and progressively working back up to Step 10 over time.

## Example Application

An intermediate male trainee (185 lbs) might complete the full pyramid in 30 minutes. For example, in Week 1, he completes Steps 1-10 and back down without assistance. If pullups become challenging, he can use TRX bands for assistance. By Week 4, he should aim to complete the pyramid faster, reducing rest between exercises.

## Important Notes

- Do not perform this workout more than twice a week to avoid overtraining.
- Modify difficulty by using TRX for assistance or to increase resistance.
- Maintain minimal rest between exercises to maximize endurance benefits.

## Volume Metrics

Total volume per session includes:
- **100 pullups**
- **200 pushups**
- **300 situps**

## Summary

The PT Pyramid is an effective bodyweight circuit designed to build muscular endurance and stamina. Its pyramid structure naturally incorporates warmup, peak effort, and cooldown phases. Ideal for individuals seeking to improve PT scores or overall endurance, it’s best suited for intermediate trainees looking to enhance their bodyweight exercise capacity.
