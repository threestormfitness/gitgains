Below are **eight EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute) lifting “modules”** that have been documented on well-known fitness sites and forums. Each module includes:

- A brief description of the set/rep structure.
- Recommended starting intensities (if specified by the source).
- Progression strategies (session-to-session or week-to-week).
- Strategies to handle plateaus.

All are written so that a new lifter can pick them up and plug them into a custom program. Where applicable, I’ve mentioned notable sources such as **T-Nation**, **r/weightroom** on Reddit, and other commonly cited programs/online communities. If a source’s language was included, it’s adapted to be direct and helpful without marketing fluff.

## 1. **10 x 1 EMOM at ~90% of 1RM**

**Documented On:** T-Nation articles by Christian Thibaudeau and in various strength threads on **r/weightroom** and **r/powerlifting**.

### Structure

- **Duration:** 10 minutes.
- **Reps Per Set:** 1 rep every minute (i.e., 10 total singles).
- **Intensity:** Around 90% of your estimated 1RM (or a challenging “heavy single” you can do consistently with good form).

### How to Do It

1. Start a running clock or timer.
2. At the start of each minute, perform **1 rep**, then rest for the remainder of the minute.
3. Aim to keep the bar speed (or movement speed) consistent and maintain excellent form.

### Progression

- **Week-to-Week:**
    - If you complete all 10 singles with solid technique, add 2.5–5 lb (1–2 kg) next time.
    - If your bar speed significantly slows or form breaks down on your last couple of singles, stay at the same weight for the next session to reinforce technique.
- **Alternate Approach:** Some lifters prefer holding the same weight for 2-3 sessions before increasing. This is also valid if you’re newer or more cautious.

### Plateau/Failure Strategy

- If you fail a rep before you get all 10 singles, **drop the weight by 5–10%** for the next session and build back up over a couple of sessions.
- Consider adjusting volume: some lifters reduce to 8 singles (8 minutes) temporarily until the movement feels solid again.

## 2. **10 x 2 EMOM at ~80% of 1RM**

**Documented On:** Variations featured in CrossFit-style strength segments and on **r/weightroom** “EMOM Strength” threads.

### Structure

- **Duration:** 10 minutes.
- **Reps Per Set:** 2 reps every minute (i.e., 10 sets of 2 = 20 total reps).
- **Intensity:** ~80% of 1RM or a weight you could do for ~5-6 solid reps in a straight set.

### How to Do It

4. Start a clock.
5. Every minute on the minute, do 2 reps; rest the remainder of the minute.
6. Keep rest times consistent—once you finish your 2 reps, use the leftover time to reset and prepare for the next minute.

### Progression

- **Session-to-Session:**
    - If all 20 reps feel solid, add 2.5–5 lb next session.
    - If the last couple of sets feel overly taxing, repeat the same load next time.
- **Microload if Necessary:** Some lifters (especially smaller or newer trainees) find adding 2.5 lb each side too big of a jump. You can add smaller microplates (1 lb or 0.5 kg plates) to ensure steady progress.

### Plateau/Failure Strategy

- If you cannot complete all sets for 2 reps, **reduce the load by 5%** and build back up.
- Alternatively, try 8 x 2 (fewer total sets) for a week or two, then go back to 10 x 2.

## 3. **10 x 3 EMOM at ~70–75% of 1RM**

**Documented On:** CrossFit Journal programming articles and commonly used in CrossFit affiliates’ strength segments. Also discussed in various “EMOM for Hypertrophy” posts on **T-Nation** forums.

### Structure

- **Duration:** 10 minutes.
- **Reps Per Set:** 3 reps every minute (total 30 reps).
- **Intensity:** Start around 70–75% of your 1RM (or a moderate weight you can do for ~8-10 reps in a regular set).

### How to Do It

7. EMOM format for 10 minutes.
8. Perform 3 reps at the top of each minute.
9. Aim to finish your triple quickly but under control to maximize rest.

### Progression

- **Week-to-Week:**
    - Add 5 lb (2.5 kg) if all sets felt comfortably challenging but doable.
    - If you’re new, you might stay at the same weight for two sessions before you add weight to ensure technique is solid at higher cumulative volumes.
- **Volume Sensitivity:** If 30 total reps is too much, start with 8-minute EMOM (8 sets total) and build to 10 minutes.

### Plateau/Failure Strategy

- If you consistently fail reps or can’t finish the sets in under 45 seconds, **drop the weight by 5–10%** and resume progression.
- Consider adjusting the reps to 2 per set (10 x 2) if you still stall.

## 4. **12 x 2 “Speed EMOM” at ~65–70%**

**Documented On:** Westside Barbell–inspired speed work (dynamic effort), often cited on **r/powerlifting** and in Louie Simmons’ writings. Adapted to EMOM format by many online lifting communities.

### Structure

- **Duration:** 12 minutes.
- **Reps Per Set:** 2 reps every minute.
- **Intensity:** About 65–70% of your 1RM. The emphasis is on bar speed and explosiveness.

### How to Do It

10. Perform 2 fast, explosive reps on the minute.
11. Focus on driving the bar (or implement) as quickly as possible through the full range of motion.
12. Rest the remainder of the minute, ensuring you’re mentally preparing to move explosively again.

### Progression

- **Weight or Speed Focus:**
    - You can slightly increase the weight (2.5–5 lb) if bar speed remains quick.
    - Alternatively, keep the same weight for multiple sessions, focusing on faster, more explosive reps each time.
- **Week-to-Week Variation:** Some lifters rotate the exercise (e.g., squat vs. box squat, bench press vs. close-grip bench) each week but keep the 65–70% range and the same structure.

### Plateau/Failure Strategy

- If explosiveness suffers or you feel too fatigued to keep reps crisp, **reduce sets** to 8 or 10 total sets for a while or reduce intensity to 60–65%.
- Work on technique—speed work demands precise form.

## 5. **Ascending-Weight EMOM (10-minute)**

**Documented On:** Programs in the CrossFit Journal and various “EMOM Ladder” threads on **r/crossfit**. Sometimes called “EMOM Ladders” or “Ramp-Up EMOMs.”

### Structure

- **Duration:** 10 minutes (10 sets total).
- **Reps Per Set:** Generally 1–2 reps each minute, with weight increasing every 1–2 minutes.
- **Intensity:** Starts moderate (~70% of 1RM) and ends near a heavy single (~90+% of 1RM).

### How to Do It

13. Divide 10 minutes into segments (for example, 5 distinct jumps in weight).
14. Perform your single or double each minute at the designated weight.
15. Every 2 minutes (or every minute if it’s a very small jump), **increase the load** by a pre-planned amount.

**Example Loading Plan (Singles):**

- Minutes 1–2: 70%
- Minutes 3–4: 75%
- Minutes 5–6: 80%
- Minutes 7–8: 85%
- Minutes 9–10: 90–92%

### Progression

- **Session-to-Session:**
    - Adjust the percentage jumps (e.g., start slightly heavier or go slightly higher at the top end) if you completed all reps easily.
    - Alternatively, keep the same jumps but add 2.5–5 lb to all jumps.
- **Note:** Because this is a heavy ladder approach, frequent small PR attempts can be built in (e.g., 1–2 lb increments each session).

### Plateau/Failure Strategy

- If you fail at the top end (your heaviest couple of sets), reduce your final jump by 2–3%. Still get comfortable at that near-max range.
- Stay at the same top weight for 2–3 sessions before trying a new max weight.

## 6. **15-Minute EMOM with Fixed Weight (5-Rep Bursts)**

**Documented On:** Discussed in “hypertrophy-oriented EMOM” threads in **r/weightroom** and occasionally in T-Nation hypertrophy advice.

### Structure

- **Duration:** 15 minutes (15 sets).
- **Reps Per Set:** 5 reps every minute (total 75 reps if all sets are completed).
- **Intensity:** Light to moderate. Usually in the 50–60% of 1RM range or about your 10–12 rep max.

### How to Do It

16. Perform 5 reps every minute on the minute.
17. The goal is to accumulate volume in a short time. Expect fatigue to build significantly by the latter sets.
18. If you can’t sustain 5 reps each minute, consider decreasing reps to 3-4 for the last sets or simply stop early if form breaks down.

### Progression

- **Week-to-Week:**
    - Start with 10 minutes (10 sets) if 15 is too high in volume, then add 1 minute each session.
    - Once you can do 15 sets of 5 reps comfortably, add a small amount of weight (2.5–5 lb) and repeat.
- **Alternative Approach:** Maintain 15 minutes, but once you hit all 75 reps, go up 2.5–5 lb next time.

### Plateau/Failure Strategy

- If you fail to complete 5 reps during multiple sets (e.g., you get only 3–4 reps some rounds), **reduce the load by 5%** the following session.
- Another option is to keep the same weight but reduce to sets of 4 reps and build back to 5s.

## 7. **20-Minute EMOM (Lower Rep, Higher Volume)**

**Documented On:** Various boxes (CrossFit affiliates) use extended 20-minute EMOMs for both conditioning and strength-endurance. Also appears in some **r/crossfit** “Hero WOD” style modifications.

### Structure

- **Duration:** 20 minutes (20 sets).
- **Reps Per Set:** 1–2 reps every minute (total 20–40 reps).
- **Intensity:** Typically 70–80% 1RM if doing 1 rep, or 60–70% if doing 2 reps. Extended structure means you’ll accumulate more total volume or practice.

### How to Do It

19. Every minute for 20 minutes, do your chosen rep count (1 or 2).
20. For single reps, you can often push a bit heavier (up to 80%). For doubles, stick to 70% or so to maintain form over so many sets.
21. Pace yourself, especially in the later sets. Keep rest intervals consistent.

### Progression

- **Incremental Loading:** If completing all 20 sets is manageable, add 2.5–5 lb next session.
- **Time/Volume Progression:** You might start with 12- or 15-minute EMOM and add 1–2 minutes each session until you reach 20. Then gradually increase weight.

### Plateau/Failure Strategy

- If you can’t complete all 20 minutes (e.g., you fail halfway through), scale down the total minutes to 15 or reduce the load by 5–10% until you can handle the full 20 minutes.
- You can also drop from 2 reps to 1 rep if you’re near the higher intensity range.

## 8. **Wave EMOM (Triplet Waves)**

**Documented On:** Various **Juggernaut Training Systems** discussions and some “wave loading” threads on **r/weightroom**. This is a wave-loading spin on EMOM.

### Structure

- **Duration:** Typically 9–12 minutes (3–4 waves total).
- **Reps Per Minute:** Cycle through something like 3 reps, 2 reps, 1 rep, then repeat.
- **Intensity:** Start with moderate loads for 3 reps, increase slightly for 2 reps, then a heavier single. Each wave might nudge the loads slightly higher.

**Example (9-minute EMOM):**

- **Minute 1:** 3 reps at ~70%
- **Minute 2:** 2 reps at ~75%
- **Minute 3:** 1 rep at ~80%
- **Minute 4:** 3 reps at ~72%
- **Minute 5:** 2 reps at ~77%
- **Minute 6:** 1 rep at ~82%
- **Minute 7:** 3 reps at ~74%
- **Minute 8:** 2 reps at ~79%
- **Minute 9:** 1 rep at ~84%

### Progression

- **Each Session:** Slightly bump the percentages if you complete all waves comfortably. For example, add 2% across the board next time.
- **Small Jumps:** Because this is a fairly technical approach, keep jumps modest (1–2% per wave from start to finish, and similarly 1–2% from session to session).

### Plateau/Failure Strategy

- If the heavier singles or doubles fail, roll back your top-end loads by ~2–3% for the next session.
- If you repeatedly stall, you might reduce to 2-wave cycles (6 minutes total) with fewer sets, rebuild consistency, and then reintroduce the 3-wave approach.

# General Tips for All EMOM Modules

22. **Choose the Right Weight:** If you regularly finish your reps with plenty of leftover time in the minute (i.e., <20 seconds of work each set), the load is probably appropriate. If you’re hitting 30–40 seconds to finish each set, you likely need a lighter weight or fewer reps.
23. **Stay Strict with Rest:** The essence of EMOM is consistent intervals. The clock is your master—start each set right on time.
24. **Technique Over Load:** Especially for new lifters, prioritize consistent form. If form breaks, reduce weight or volume.
25. **When You Stall:**
    - **Lower the Weight** by 5–10% or
    - **Reduce Total Sets/Minutes** (e.g., from 10 to 8 sets) or
    - **Reduce Reps** (from 3 to 2 or from 5 to 3).  
        Then rebuild.
26. **Progress Gradually:** EMOM can be taxing. Adding weight too quickly often leads to plateaus or form issues.

These eight modules have each been used and documented in reputable sources (T-Nation articles, r/weightroom and r/powerlifting threads, CrossFit Journal, Juggernaut discussions). Pick the one(s) that best suit your goals (strength, hypertrophy, or speed) and adapt the progressions and plateau strategies as needed.
