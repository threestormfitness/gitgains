## Overview and Execution

In **5×10**, you typically work at a lighter percentage of your max (often 50–60% 1RM) for high-volume sets. Perform five sets of 10 reps each, resting about 1–2 minutes between sets. Increase by about 5 lb once you can complete all 5 sets without failing.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you fail to reach 10 reps for two straight sessions, reduce your training weight by 5–10% and climb back up as before.

## Example Application

- **Week 1**: 5×10 @ 100 lb
- **Week 2**: 5×10 @ 105 lb
- **Week 3**: 5×10 @ 110 lb if successful.
- If stalling at 110 lb for two weeks, drop to 100 lb or 95 lb and progress again.

## Important Notes

- This module is common as an accessory to heavy main lifts (like in Wendler’s “Boring But Big”).
- Expect significant muscle fatigue; do not compromise form toward the end of each set.

## Volume Metrics

5 sets × 10 reps = 50 total reps.

## Summary

**5×10** provides substantial hypertrophy stimulus and improved work capacity. It’s well-suited for intermediate lifters who can handle higher volume without risking form deterioration.
