## Overview and Execution

The Heavy/Light/Medium (HLM) 3-Day Split is a balanced training program that is executed three times a week. Each training session focuses on different intensity levels to allow for recovery while promoting gains:

- **Heavy Day**: Perform 5 sets of 5 reps (5×5) near your 5-rep max (5RM). This is the most intense session of the week.
- **Light Day**: Perform 2 sets of 5 reps (2×5) at approximately 70% of your 5RM. This session is designed for recovery while maintaining frequency.
- **Medium Day**: Perform 3 sets of 5 reps (3×5) at about 85% of your 5RM. This serves as a moderate-intensity session aiming for strength development without the stress of heavy days.

Cycle through the main lifts with these intensity ranges to ensure balanced development. This module caters to intermediate lifters seeking sustainable progress.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

While this module doesn’t explicitly mention plateau strategies, adjust percentages as you progress. If you experience stalling, it's advisable to incorporate deload weeks or reassess your current training intensity and recovery practices.

## Example Application

A real-world example of applying this program might look like this for the squat exercise over a week:

- **Monday (Heavy Day)**: Squat 5×5 at 315 lbs
- **Wednesday (Light Day)**: Squat 2×5 at 225 lbs
- **Friday (Medium Day)**: Squat 3×5 at 270 lbs

This routine maintains recovery with varying intensity levels while promoting regular strength gains.

## Important Notes

- Prioritize proper form and avoid training to failure to prevent injuries.
- Adapt percentages based on your individual progress—these are starting points, not absolute rules.
- This program is especially beneficial for intermediate trainees who need a structured plan that accommodates recovery.

## Volume Metrics

Each week, you will perform approximately:

- **50 Total Reps per Lift**: 
  - ~25 reps on Heavy Day
  - ~10 reps on Light Day
  - ~15 reps on Medium Day

This balanced volume helps in gaining strength while allowing adequate recovery.

## Summary

The Heavy/Light/Medium 3-Day Split (HLM) offers a balanced, flexible approach to intermediate training, ideal for those looking to sustain progress without risking overtraining. It emphasizes varying intensity levels throughout the week to maximize recovery and development. This module can be easily adjusted based on individual needs, helping lifters surpass plateaus and achieve steady growth over time.
