### Overview and Execution

GZCLP Tier 3 focuses on **accessory exercises** (e.g., lat pulldowns, dumbbell rows) performed for higher reps. Do **3×15** with the **last set as an AMRAP**. Once you reach about 25 reps on the last set, add weight for the next workout. Rest around 1–1.5 minutes between sets, aiming for controlled movement and strict form.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

Not typically addressed here—if you can’t achieve 15 reps on the first two sets or can’t progress to 25 on the AMRAP, consider dropping the weight slightly or adding another session or two at the same load until you adapt.

### Example Application

If you start lat pulldowns at **60 lb** for 15, 15, and 20 reps (on the last set), keep that load until the final set reaches **25** reps. Then, increase to **65 lb** next session and repeat. Over a few weeks, your final set might climb from 20 → 22 → 25, triggering your next weight jump.

### Important Notes

- Focus on **form** over load, as accessories target hypertrophy and movement patterning.
- Leave 1–2 reps in reserve, don’t push to absolute failure on the AMRAP.

### Volume Metrics

- Each session is **3×15**, with the last set often exceeding 15 (AMRAP) until 25 reps are reached.

### Summary

GZCLP Tier 3 complements the heavy T1 and moderate T2 work with **high-rep accessory exercises**, promoting muscular endurance and size. This tier is especially helpful for building back strength and addressing weak points without overly taxing the central nervous system.
