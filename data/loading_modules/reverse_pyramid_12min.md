## Overview and Execution

Begin with a heavy set targeting ~6 reps at approximately 80-85% of your 1RM. Rest for 2-3 minutes. Reduce the load by around 10-15% and aim for ~8 reps. Rest for 2 minutes before reducing the weight again for a final set of ~10 reps at about 65% of your 1RM. Once you can complete all your reps comfortably, increase the weight of your top set. Consistency in rest times is crucial for maintaining intensity across sessions.

## Example Application

### Squat Routine

- **Week 1:**
  - Set 1: 6 reps × 300 lbs
  - Set 2: 8 reps × 270 lbs
  - Set 3: 10 reps × 240 lbs
  
- **Progression:**
  - Once hitting 6-8-10 easily, increase the top set weight (e.g., move to 310 lbs for the first set).

This sample routine underscores the importance of maintaining strict rest intervals to preserve workout intensity and to assess progress accurately through gradual weight increments.

## Important Notes

- The first set is the heaviest, decreasing load while increasing repetitions in the following sets.
- Adhering to strict rest intervals is key for optimal performance and progression.
- Push your last set near failure to ensure maximum muscle recruitment.

## Volume Metrics

Approximately 24 total reps are performed per exercise session, derived from the breakdown of 6, 8, and 10 repetitions across three sets.

## Summary

Reverse Pyramid Training is a powerful, time-efficient approach popularized by Martin Berkhan of Leangains. This module is best suited for lifters who have a good grasp of their strength capacities and seek to push through intermediate training plateaus. By focusing on a descending rep and weight model, trainees can maximize their strength gains and improve muscular endurance within a single exercise session.
