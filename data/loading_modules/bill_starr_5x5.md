## Overview and Execution

The Bill Starr 5×5 is a classic strength training module focusing on progressive overload using ramping sets. Each session progresses through 5 sets of increasing weight (e.g., 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, up to 90% of a top set), with the final set being the main focus. If successful on the top set, increase the weight for the next session. This program is designed primarily for big barbell lifts and does not employ advanced techniques like AMRAP or autoregulation.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If progress stalls on the top set, it's advisable to introduce a deload week and then resume with adjusted weights. Monitoring rest intervals and recovery can also be crucial in continuing progress without reaching a plateau.

## Example Application

- **Week 1:**
  - Squat: 135×5, 185×5, 225×5, 275×5, 315×5 (top set)
- **Week 2:**
  - Squat: 135×5, 185×5, 225×5, 275×5, 320×5 (top set)

This straightforward progression illustrates the incremental approach, aiming for weekly increases on the top set.

## Important Notes

- It's essential not to overshoot on the early sets; each set should serve as a proper warm-up leading to the top set.
- The final set is the main driver for strength adaptation.
- This module is especially beneficial for novice to intermediate lifters looking to add weight weekly.

## Volume Metrics

The program involves 25 total reps (5 sets × 5 reps) for each main lift per session.

## Summary

The Bill Starr 5×5 (Linear Progression) is ideal for lifters seeking steady, methodical strength gains, particularly those in the novice to intermediate range. Its emphasis on ramping sets prepares the lifter for a challenging top set each session, fostering gradual improvement and technical mastery of key barbell movements.
