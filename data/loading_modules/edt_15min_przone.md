## Overview and Execution

Choose two exercises, often antagonistic pairs (e.g., pushing vs. pulling movements). Set a 15-minute timer and alternate between sets of 5-10 reps for each exercise. Rest just enough to maintain good form throughout the session. Aim for as many sets as possible within the time, and record the total reps completed. In subsequent sessions, attempt to beat the total reps to facilitate progress.

## Example Application

An example session may include:

- **A1:** Chin-ups
- **A2:** Dips

Within the 15-minute period, participants aim to complete as many mini-sets as possible. Suppose the initial score equals 100 total reps (50 chin-ups + 50 dips). In the next session, the goal would be to surpass 105 total reps.

## Important Notes

- Keep each mini-set to sub-failure to sustain performance across the session.
- This method effectively targets hypertrophy and conditioning, fostering incremental progress through the "PR Zone" approach.

## Volume Metrics

All sets are completed within the 15-minute session, with the primary aim to exceed the previous session's total reps to measure improvement.

## Summary

The Escalating Density Training (EDT) module is an excellent option for intermediate trainees looking to improve hypertrophy and conditioning through a time-efficient strategy. By targeting a defined volume within a "PR Zone," trainees can consistently track progress and enhance performance longevity across a 4-6 week cycle. Adaptability and progressive overload are key drivers of success in this regimen.
