### 3×8–12 Progression Scheme

1. **Basic Approach**  
   - Choose a single movement (e.g., dumbbell bench press) and perform it once per week using a 3×8–12 progression.  
   - Start with *3 sets of 8 reps* at a weight you can handle comfortably for 10–12 reps with perfect form (around your 10–12RM).  
   - Once you successfully complete all 3 sets of 8 (with good form), move up to *3 sets of 10* the following session at the **same weight**.  
   - After you can do 3×10, progress to *3 sets of 12*.  
   - When you can finish 3×12 (again, with good form), **increase the load** by 5–10 lb and drop back down to 3×8 at the new weight.  

2. **Plateau or Stalling Strategies**  
   - **Record & Retry**  
     - If you fail to reach the target number of reps in a session, note how many you did achieve.  
     - Try to surpass that number the next week. If you eventually hit the target (e.g., 3×10), move on (to 3×12).  
     - If you’re stuck, switch to a different but similar exercise and restart the progression.  
   - **Add a Fourth Set**  
     - Return to the last successful iteration (or a conservative weight from a prior cycle).  
     - Now do *4 sets* instead of 3. Build up through 4×8, then 4×10, etc., until you reach your previous plateau.  
     - After that, attempt to go back to 3 sets and break through.  
   - **Switch Modules**  
     - If adding sets or retrying doesn’t work, change to another rep scheme or loading approach (e.g., 12-10-8-6, 5/3/1, APRE, etc.).
