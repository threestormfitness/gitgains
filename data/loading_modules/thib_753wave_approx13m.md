## Overview and Execution

This module uses a wave loading approach that blends strength and hypertrophy. Each “wave” involves three sets: 7 reps, then 5 reps, then 3 reps, with the load increasing as reps decrease. After completing the first wave (7-5-3), you optionally begin the second wave with a slightly heavier load than your first wave.

- **Wave 1**  
  - 7 reps at a moderately light load (e.g., ~75% 1RM)  
  - 5 reps at a heavier load (~80% 1RM)  
  - 3 reps at an even heavier load (~85% 1RM)

- **Wave 2**  
  - 7 reps, slightly heavier than your first 7-rep set (e.g., ~80% 1RM)  
  - 5 reps, slightly heavier than your first 5-rep set (~85% 1RM)  
  - 3 reps, slightly heavier than your first 3-rep set (~90% 1RM)

> **Rest Intervals**: Aim for about 90–180 seconds between sets, allowing enough recovery to maintain performance while also harnessing post-tetanic potentiation.

Limit yourself to **two waves**. Past that point, fatigue generally outweighs the benefits and can diminish performance.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

*(No explicit stalling strategies were provided in the JSON or source. If you do encounter missed reps or stalls, consider slightly reducing loads in subsequent waves or adding a brief deload week before retrying.)*

## Example Application

Below is a simple outline of how an intermediate 185 lb male trainee might run this program on a main exercise (e.g., Barbell Back Squat) twice per week for three weeks:

**Week 1 (Day 1):**  
- Wave 1: 
  - 7 reps @ ~75% of 1RM  
  - 5 reps @ ~80% of 1RM  
  - 3 reps @ ~85% of 1RM  
- Wave 2: 
  - 7 reps @ ~80% of 1RM  
  - 5 reps @ ~85% of 1RM  
  - 3 reps @ ~90% of 1RM  

**Week 1 (Day 2):**  
- Wave 1: 
  - 7 reps @ ~76% (slight increase from Day 1)  
  - 5 reps @ ~81%  
  - 3 reps @ ~86%  
- Wave 2: 
  - 7 reps @ ~81%  
  - 5 reps @ ~86%  
  - 3 reps @ ~91%  

Each week, you might increase each percentage by 1–2% if the previous sessions were successful and felt manageable. This progression continues over several weeks, or until you reach a peak intensity or experience diminished performance.

## Important Notes

- **Limit to Two Waves**: Going beyond two waves often leads to excessive fatigue with minimal additional benefit.  
- **Conservative Starts**: Begin Wave 1 with a load you know you can manage for the prescribed reps.  
- **Avoid Training to Failure**: Stopping just shy of failure helps maintain better performance in subsequent sets.  
- **Autoregulate**: If performance drops drastically, reduce load slightly or extend rest.  

---

## Volume Metrics

**2 waves × (7 + 5 + 3) = 30 total reps per exercise**.  
- For a single movement (e.g., squat), expect around 30 reps.  
- Adjust the number of exercises and accessories based on your overall program volume needs.

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s 7-5-3 Wave module is a **wave loading** protocol designed to develop both size and strength. By starting with moderate loads for higher reps (7) and progressing to heavier loads for lower reps (3), it targets multiple aspects of muscular development. This approach is best suited for **intermediate to advanced lifters** who can handle relatively heavy loads while maintaining proper technique. Keep waves limited to two to avoid excessive fatigue, and autoregulate as needed to ensure continued progress.
