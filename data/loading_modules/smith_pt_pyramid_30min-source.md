# PT Pyramid Workout

## Overview
The PT Pyramid is a bodyweight endurance workout designed to build muscular stamina and cardiovascular fitness. It integrates a warmup, maximum effort, and cooldown in a single session, making it a comprehensive training tool for improving PT test scores and overall endurance. The workout follows a pyramid structure, increasing in difficulty to a peak before descending back down.

## Structure
You perform pullups, pushups, and situps in a progressive manner, increasing reps as you ascend the pyramid and decreasing reps as you descend.

### Ascending the Pyramid (Warmup to Max Effort)
1. **Set 1:** 1 pullup / 2 pushups / 3 situps  
2. **Set 2:** 2 pullups / 4 pushups / 6 situps  
3. **Set 3:** 3 pullups / 6 pushups / 9 situps  
4. **Set 4:** 4 pullups / 8 pushups / 12 situps  
5. **Set 5:** 5 pullups / 10 pushups / 15 situps  
6. **Set 6:** 6 pullups / 12 pushups / 18 situps  
7. **Set 7:** 7 pullups / 14 pushups / 21 situps  
8. **Set 8:** 8 pullups / 16 pushups / 24 situps  
9. **Set 9:** 9 pullups / 18 pushups / 27 situps  
10. **Set 10:** 10 pullups / 20 pushups / 30 situps (Max Effort)

### Descending the Pyramid (Max Effort to Cooldown)
1. **Set 9:** 9 pullups / 18 pushups / 27 situps  
2. **Set 8:** 8 pullups / 16 pushups / 24 situps  
3. **Set 7:** 7 pullups / 14 pushups / 21 situps  
4. **Set 6:** 6 pullups / 12 pushups / 18 situps  
5. **Set 5:** 5 pullups / 10 pushups / 15 situps  
6. **Set 4:** 4 pullups / 8 pushups / 12 situps  
7. **Set 3:** 3 pullups / 6 pushups / 9 situps  
8. **Set 2:** 2 pullups / 4 pushups / 6 situps  
9. **Set 1:** 1 pullup / 2 pushups / 3 situps (Cooldown)

## Load Selection Guidelines
This is a bodyweight-focused workout. However, you can adjust the difficulty by:
- **Using TRX bands** to either assist with pullups or make pushups more challenging.
- **Adding dips** equal to the number of pushups for additional triceps and shoulder engagement.
- **Incorporating sprints** (e.g., 100-meter sprints between sets) for added cardiovascular intensity.

## Rest Intervals
- **Minimal Rest:** There are no dedicated rest periods. Recovery happens while transitioning between exercises.
- **Modify Rest:** If fatigued, brief pauses can be taken, but aim to keep rest minimal to maintain endurance benefits.

## Execution / Key Considerations
- Perform this workout **1-2 times per week** to avoid overtraining.
- Do not attempt this workout **daily**; allow at least one rest day between sessions.
- Consider hydration and electrolyte replacement, especially if incorporating sprints.
- The pyramid naturally integrates a **warmup (early sets)**, a **max effort (peak set 10)**, and a **cooldown (descending sets)**.

## Summary
The PT Pyramid is an efficient, scalable workout that builds endurance, strength, and muscular stamina. Its progressive structure challenges you to reach your max effort while integrating natural warmup and cooldown phases. Ideal for improving PT scores or as part of a broader fitness regimen, it can be tailored with TRX bands, dips, or sprints to match your fitness level.
