  "overview_and_execution": "Perform 3 waves, each wave consisting of 1 set of 3 reps at near-max load, rest at least 2 min, then 1 eccentric-only rep (8–10s negative) with ~10% more weight. Rest again, then repeat for 3 total waves.",
  "example_application": "If your 3RM bench press is 225 lbs, wave 1 might be 3 reps at 225, rest 2 min, 1 eccentric rep at ~245, rest 2 min, then wave 2 increases the triple to 230 and the single to 250, etc.",
  "important_notes": "Stop the eccentric single if you cannot maintain an 8–10 second descent. Adjust loads if form or tempo suffers.",
  "volume_metrics": "6 total sets per session (3 sets of 3 reps + 3 single-rep sets) = 12 total reps."
