  "overview_and_execution": "The Boring But Big (BBB) Up/Down module consists of 5 sets of 10 reps with a wave-like intensity pattern. The percentages used are 50%, 60%, 70%, 60%, and 50% of Training Max (TM). This structure allows for a heavier peak set in the middle while maintaining volume and reducing excessive fatigue. Rest between sets is 60–120 seconds. The progression model involves gradually increasing the training max over cycles, allowing the weights to self-regulate.",
  "example_application": "Week 1: 5x10 @ 50%, 60%, 70%, 60%, 50% TM. Week 2: Increase top set by 5 lbs. Week 3: Progress to next cycle, adjusting weight as needed.",
  "important_notes": "Start conservatively, especially for lower body lifts, as the high rep scheme can be fatiguing. Superset pressing movements with lat work for efficiency. Avoid excessive fatigue, particularly on squats and deadlifts. If needed, modify with lighter assistance movements like good mornings or Romanian deadlifts instead of heavy deadlifts.",
  "volume_metrics": "5 sets of 10 reps per exercise"
