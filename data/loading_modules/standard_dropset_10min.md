### Overview and Execution

Perform 8–10 reps close to failure with your initial weight. Immediately drop the weight by 10–20% and go to failure again, then drop once more by 10–20% and repeat. Rest 1–2 minutes after completing the entire drop sequence if doing multiple rounds or moving to another exercise. Once you can easily exceed 10 reps on your initial heavy set, add 2.5–5 lb next time.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you stall, try adding a brief rest-pause (e.g., 10–15 seconds) before continuing with your drop sets.
- You can also add partial reps at the end of each drop to squeeze out additional progress.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**:
    - **Bench Press**: 185×8 → drop to 165×AMRAP → drop to 145×AMRAP
    - Rest 1–2 minutes, then move on.
- **Week 2**:
    - If you got 10 reps or more on the first set, move to 190 lb for the initial set; otherwise, repeat 185 lb.
    - Continue the same drop percentages each time.

### Important Notes

- Keep rest minimal between drops so the muscles remain under stress.
- Use caution with form as the muscle fatigue accumulates rapidly during drop sets.

### Volume Metrics

Typically 3 “work segments” per sequence (1 initial set + 2 drops), repeated 1–2 times per exercise, depending on your program structure.

### Summary

The Standard Drop Set is a simple yet intense method for hypertrophy, suitable for intermediate or advanced lifters looking to extend sets past normal failure. It’s quick to implement (about 10 minutes per exercise) and works well for hitting a muscle group hard in a short timeframe.
