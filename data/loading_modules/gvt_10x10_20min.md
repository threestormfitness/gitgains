## Overview and Execution

Perform 10 sets of 10 repetitions using a load of approximately 60% of your one-rep max (1RM). Allow approximately 60 to 90 seconds of rest between sets. Once you successfully complete all 10 sets, increase the weight in the next session. This method involves performing either compound or isolation movements and is demanding on the body.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

The program emphasizes progressing the load once all sets and reps are completed successfully. If you hit a plateau and are unable to complete all 10 reps across sets, maintain the weight until you overcome the barrier. Ensure adequate rest and recovery, and consider a deload week if necessary.

## Example Application

For an intermediate male trainee weighing 185 lbs, an example might involve the bench press:

- **Week 1**: Bench Press 10×10 @ 135 lbs, with 60s rest.
- **Week 2**: If successful in Week 1, increase to 140 lbs and continue with 10×10 format.
- **Week 3-4**: Continue increasing load by 5 lbs each subsequent week, provided all 10×10 reps are completed.
  
This example illustrates systematic progression from week to week with a focus on gradually increasing strength and endurance.

## Important Notes

German Volume Training is a highly taxing training regimen. It is recommended to perform just one GVT-style exercise per muscle group to prevent overtraining. After 4-6 weeks of such intensity, a deload phase is suggested to allow for recovery and adaptation.

## Volume Metrics

The volume for this program can be calculated as follows:  
- Total Reps = 10 sets × 10 reps = 100 total reps per exercise session.

## Summary

German Volume Training is a time-efficient and intense program tailored for individuals looking to intensify their strength and muscle endurance. It is particularly suited for intermediate to advanced trainees aiming to break through strength plateaus with high-volume sessions. Proper recovery and adherence to a deload period are necessary to prevent overtraining and ensure long-term progress.
