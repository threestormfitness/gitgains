  "overview_and_execution": "Select two antagonistic exercises. Use a 6RM load for each. Set a timer for 15 minutes and alternate between exercises, performing up to 3 reps per set with minimal rest. As fatigue sets in, reduce to 2 or 1 rep per set. Record total reps for each exercise to establish a PR. In subsequent sessions, aim to exceed the previous total reps before increasing weight by 2.5-5%.",
  "example_application": "Example: Shoulder Press (135 lbs) & Lat Pulldown (180 lbs). Perform up to 3 reps per set for each exercise, alternating with minimal rest. Over 15 minutes, accumulate total reps (e.g., 26 shoulder press reps and 30 lat pulldown reps). In future sessions, aim to exceed these totals.",
  "important_notes": "Do not exceed 3 reps per set. Maintain proper form throughout. Select exercises that are simple and safe under fatigue. When plateauing, reduce rest periods, modify rep schemes, or slightly adjust exercises.",
  "volume_metrics": "Typically 24-36 reps per exercise over 15 minutes, depending on fatigue and progression."
