## Overview and Execution

**3×12** targets hypertrophy and muscular endurance at slightly higher rep ranges. Perform three sets of 12 reps, resting ~1–2 minutes between sets. Increase the load by 2.5–5 lb when you complete 3×12 successfully.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you fail to reach 12 reps for two sessions in a row, deload by ~10% and resume progression from there.

## Example Application

- **Week 1**: 3×12 @ 70 lb
- **Week 2**: 3×12 @ 75 lb
- **Week 3**: If you fail at 80 lb (12, 12, 9), retry 80 lb next session.
- If stuck again, drop to ~70 lb and work back up.

## Important Notes

- Prioritize form and tempo, as higher reps can lead to fatigue-based technique breakdown.
- Particularly useful for accessory or isolation work.

## Volume Metrics

3 sets × 12 reps = 36 total reps.

## Summary

The **3×12** scheme is well-suited for lifters aiming to increase muscle size and endurance, fitting neatly into hypertrophy-focused blocks.
