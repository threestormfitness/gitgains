## 7-5-3 Wave Loading

### Overview
The 7-5-3 wave loading scheme blends strength and hypertrophy work by using moderately high reps (7) down to low reps (3). Each “wave” increases the load as reps decrease, then a new wave starts slightly lighter than the last set and builds up again.

### Structure
- **Wave 1**  
  1. Set 1: 7 reps (light-to-moderate load)  
  2. Set 2: 5 reps (increase load)  
  3. Set 3: 3 reps (further increase load)
- **Wave 2 (if applicable)**  
  1. Set 4: 7 reps (heavier than Set 1)  
  2. Set 5: 5 reps (heavier than Set 2)  
  3. Set 6: 3 reps (heavier than Set 3)

You typically perform 1–2 waves (2 at most due to fatigue).  

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Start conservatively for Wave 1, especially on the 7-rep set, which also serves as a warm-up/primer.  
- Each subsequent set increases weight slightly.  
- For Wave 2, your first set is around the weight you used for the 5-rep set in Wave 1, then progress in similar increments for the 5- and 3-rep sets.

### Rest Intervals
- Aim for 90–180 seconds between sets to allow for partial recovery and “post-tetanic potentiation.”  
- Adjust based on personal recovery needs (some lifters need more rest, others prefer less).

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Ideal for lifters who want to build size and strength simultaneously.  
- The higher initial reps produce more metabolic and hypertrophic stimulus, while the lower reps tap into neurological strength gains.  
- Limit to 2 waves to avoid excessive fatigue.

### Summary
Use 7-5-3 waves when you need a blend of muscle size and strength improvements. The initial higher-rep set primes the body before moving to heavier, lower-rep work. Perform 1 or 2 waves per exercise and progress loads modestly to avoid burnout.
