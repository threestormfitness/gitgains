## Overview and Execution

Omni-Contraction Training is designed to enhance muscle hypertrophy by incorporating various tempo changes within the same workout session. This module requires three sets per exercise, each emphasizing a different contraction tempo:

- **1st Set:** Normal tempo (~2-0-1), focusing on control and stability.
- **2nd Set:** Slow negative (~4-1-1), emphasizing time under tension during the eccentric phase.
- **3rd Set:** Explosive concentric (~2-0-X), focusing on power and speed during the concentric phase.

Each set should aim for 8-12 reps, using a moderate load. Rest approximately 60-90 seconds between sets.

## Example Application

For practical use:

- **Exercise:** Biceps curl
  - **Set 1:** Execute 8 reps at a normal tempo (~2-0-1). 
  - **Set 2:** Perform 8 reps with a slow negative (~4-1-1).
  - **Set 3:** Complete 8 reps with explosive concentric movement (~2-0-X).

If the session feels too easy, adjust by increasing the weight incrementally. Repeat these sets over a 2-4 week cycle, adjusting as necessary to accommodate strength adaptations.

## Important Notes

- This module targets muscle development through a variety of contraction speeds.
- Best suited for short-duration hypertrophy blocks.
- While not primarily focused on training to failure, attempt to approach failure on the last set for maximal benefit.
- Recommended for individuals familiar with tempo manipulation in training.

## Volume Metrics

Each session consists of:
- **3 sets** per exercise.
- **24-36 total reps** (across different contraction tempos).

## Summary

Omni-Contraction Training provides a robust approach for those aiming to enhance muscle hypertrophy through diverse contraction speeds. Suitable for intermediate to advanced trainees, this module offers a novel method of engaging muscle fibers, assisting in overcoming potential training plateaus. Ideal for lifters seeking a short turnaround in strength and hypertrophy gains.
