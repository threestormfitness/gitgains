## Overview and Execution

A “block” approach to wave loading means sticking with one wave scheme (e.g., 7-5-3, 5-3-1, 3-2-1) for several consecutive weeks before moving to a new scheme. This creates focused progression blocks where you can adapt to one pattern before shifting to another.

- **Block 1 (Weeks 1–4)**  
  - Wave scheme: 7-5-3  
  - Perform 2 (or more) “waves” per main exercise.  
  - Start with slightly conservative weights, then increase each wave (e.g., if your first wave uses 70% on the 7-rep set, 75% on the 5-rep, and 80% on the 3-rep, your second wave might use 72–73% → 77–78% → 82–83%).

- **Block 2 (Weeks 5–8)**  
  - Wave scheme: 5-3-1  
  - Aim for 2–3 waves per main exercise.  
  - Increase the load each wave in a similar fashion (e.g., if you start wave 1 with 80% for 5 reps, wave 2 might be ~82% for 5 reps).

- **Block 3 (Weeks 9–11)**  
  - Wave scheme: 3-2-1  
  - Perform 2–3 waves per main exercise.  
  - Loads are now near-maximal. Start each week slightly lower (90–92%) and work up to heavier sets (~95+%).

**Rest Intervals**: Typically 90–180 seconds between sets. Adjust as reps get lower and loads get heavier—some may prefer up to 3 minutes for the lower-rep waves.

**Progression**: 
1. Start each block conservatively for the first week to allow room for progressive overload.  
2. Aim to add small weight increments session-to-session or wave-to-wave within each block.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

*(No direct stalling strategies are specified in the JSON or source. You may consider introducing a lighter session or small weight reset if you fail prescribed reps.)*

## Example Application

**Scenario**: An advanced 185-lb male lifter with a roughly 315-lb 1RM bench press, 405-lb 1RM squat, and 455-lb 1RM deadlift.

- **Weeks 1–4 (7-5-3)**  
  - **Squat**: Wave 1 at ~65–70% for 7 reps, 75% for 5 reps, 80% for 3 reps. Wave 2 slightly heavier (e.g., +5–10 lbs).  
  - **Bench**: Similar structure, starting at ~67–70% for 7 reps, ~75% for 5 reps, ~80–82% for 3 reps, then add small increments for Wave 2.  
  - **Deadlift**: Possibly keep volume lower (1–2 waves) due to the taxing nature of deadlifts.

- **Weeks 5–8 (5-3-1)**  
  - **Squat**: Wave 1 at ~75% for 5 reps, ~82% for 3 reps, ~88% for 1 rep. Wave 2 at ~77–78% → ~84–85% → ~90–92%.  
  - **Bench**: Start around ~77% for 5 reps, ~84% for 3 reps, ~90% for 1 rep; progress similarly each wave.  
  - **Deadlift**: 2 waves, starting around ~75–80% → ~85% → ~90+% for the triple and single.

- **Weeks 9–11 (3-2-1)**  
  - **Squat**: Wave 1 might be 85%×3, 90%×2, 92–93%×1; Wave 2 or 3 might push up to 95+% on the single.  
  - **Bench**: Similar approach, starting with ~87–88% for 3 reps, ~92% for 2 reps, ~95% for 1 rep, and attempting heavier loads in subsequent waves.  
  - **Deadlift**: Typically 1–2 waves. Consider up to 95+% by the final single.

## Important Notes

- **Progression of Reps**: Transition from higher-rep waves (size/hypertrophy focus) to moderate- and then low-rep waves (strength focus).  
- **No Training to Failure**: Each set should end with at least 1 rep “in reserve.”  
- **Autoregulated**: Adjust loads if you feel fatigue is accumulating too quickly or if you miss reps.  
- **Block Duration**: Blocks typically last 3–4 weeks to allow adaptation.  
- **Final Phase**: The 3-2-1 waves are near-maximal, so pay close attention to recovery and technique.

---

## Volume Metrics

- **Varies by block; wave structure changes each phase.**  
- As a rough guideline, each wave consists of 3 sets (for example, 7-5-3). If performing 2 waves, that’s 6 total sets per exercise per session in that block. The exact total depends on how many waves you perform and which exercises you include.

## Summary

Thibaudeau’s Wave Loading Block Approach is an 11-week program divided into three distinct wave-loading phases. Each block focuses on a particular rep scheme—progressing from moderate-to-high reps (7-5-3) to moderate-to-low reps (5-3-1) and finally culminating in near-maximal loads (3-2-1). This structured progression allows lifters to gradually build hypertrophy and improve strength over multiple waves before transitioning into heavier intensities. It’s well-suited for intermediate and advanced trainees looking for a clear, methodical progression plan with built-in variety and autoregulation.
