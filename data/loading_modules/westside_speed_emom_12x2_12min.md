### Overview and Execution

Perform **2 explosive reps on the minute** for 12 total minutes, aiming for **65–70%** of your 1RM. The emphasis is on bar speed—move the weight as quickly as possible while maintaining control. After each mini set, rest until the top of the next minute.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you notice your speed dropping significantly, reduce the weight or cut down to 10 sets to maintain explosiveness.
- If the weight feels too easy and speed is high, increase by 5 lb (or a small percentage) the next session.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 12 x 2 at 135 lb. Monitor bar speed; if it remains explosive through set 12, next session you can go to 140 lb.
- **Week 2**: 12 x 2 at 140 lb. If speed lags on the final sets, stay at 140 lb until it improves.

### Important Notes

- Keep each set as explosive as possible—this is “dynamic effort” work popularized by Westside Barbell.
- Maintain proper technique to avoid injury while moving the bar quickly.

### Volume Metrics

- **Total volume**: 12 × 2 = 24 reps.

### Summary

This module is ideal for improving explosive strength and power. By pairing moderate loads (65–70%) with low-rep, high-speed sets in an EMOM format, you train dynamic effort effectively while keeping total session time short.
