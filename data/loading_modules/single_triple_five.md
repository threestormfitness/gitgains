## Overview and Execution

To execute the Single/Triple/Five Progression, initiate with a heavy single at approximately 90% of your one-rep max (1RM). After completing the single, rest for 2-3 minutes, then reduce the weight by about 10% to perform a set of 3 reps. Following another rest, decrease the weight by an additional 10% for a 5-rep set. The goal is to increase each load across sessions or to reduce the percentage drop for subsequent sets as you progress.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If progress stalls, consider incorporating a longer rest between sets or implementing a minor deload. Ensure to monitor your recovery and technique to prevent stalling points. Emphasize gradual increases in single-set weights, aiming for smaller percentage adjustments when possible.

## Example Application

Consider a regular training session focused on deadlifts for an intermediate trainee weighing 185 lbs:

- **Session 1**:  
  - Single: 1×365 lbs  
  - Triple: 3×325 lbs  
  - Five: 5×295 lbs  
  - Aim: Progress the single to a heavier weight in next sessions or reduce the weight drop on subsequent sets.

## Important Notes

This progression blends significant strength work with moderate volume effectively. It's designed particularly for intermediate lifters who are constrained for time. It's crucial to avoid failing during the initial single lift to maintain progression and safety.

## Volume Metrics

The total volume of the program consists of:

- **Reps**: 1 (single) + 3 (triple) + 5 (fives) = 9 total reps per session

## Summary

The Single/Triple/Five Progression is an adaptable loading scheme designed for compound lifts that suits intermediate lifters needing effective yet time-efficient strength sessions. This module emphasizes autoregulation and progressive overload while encouraging lifters to manage intensity and rest intervals to maximize strength gains.
