  "overview_and_execution": "Select two opposing exercises and use your 10RM load. Set a timer for 15 minutes and alternate between the exercises, performing up to 5 reps per set. Adjust reps as fatigue accumulates while maintaining good form. Rest minimally between sets to maximize total reps. Aim to beat your previous session's total rep count.",
  "example_application": "Perform Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press (10RM = 50 lbs) and Lat Pulldown (10RM = 120 lbs). Complete up to 5 reps per set, alternating between exercises for 15 minutes. First session might total 42 reps per exercise. Next session, aim for 43+ reps.",
  "important_notes": "Focus on maintaining good form while trying to accumulate more total reps each session. The short rest periods and accumulated fatigue will naturally reduce the reps per set as the session progresses.",
  "volume_metrics": "Varies; typically 40-50 total reps per exercise in 15 minutes."
