## Overview and Execution

Double Progression requires you to progress both in **reps** and in **weight**:

1. Pick a rep range (8–12).
2. Do 3–4 sets, stopping each set at RPE 8.
3. Once you can achieve the upper limit of the rep range (12 reps, for instance) on **all** sets without exceeding RPE 8, you add weight in the next session.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: If you can’t increase reps or the load feels too heavy, do a week with fewer sets or a lower RPE.
- **Adjust Rep Range**: Move from 8–12 to 6–10 if progress slows.

## Example Application

A 185 lb lifter aiming for hypertrophy on bench press:

- **Week 1**: 4×8 at 185 lb. All sets at RPE 8.
- **Week 2**: 4×9 at 185 lb. If the last set is still RPE 8, continue.
- **Week 3**: If you reach 4×12 at RPE ≤8, move to 190 lb next session.

## Important Notes

- Straightforward approach for novice to intermediate lifters who want consistent progress.
- Avoid pushing beyond RPE 8 or the rep cap; the method is about building up to the top end gradually.

## Volume Metrics

Each session is typically 3–4 sets of 8–12 reps, so 24–48 total reps per exercise. This volume can be substantial for hypertrophy.

## Summary

Double Progression with RPE Caps is a simple, linear method that progresses volume first, then intensity. It’s beginner-friendly yet remains effective for intermediate lifters who need an easy-to-track progression strategy without burnout.
