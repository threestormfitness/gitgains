### Overview and Execution

> Use two waves per main exercise. Each wave has sets of 6, 4, and 2 reps, increasing the load each set. The second wave starts heavier than the first.

**Additional Explanation**

- This module employs “wave loading,” where each set in a wave is heavier than the previous.
- You perform 6 reps, then 4 reps, then 2 reps—each at an increased load.
- After completing the first 3 sets (Wave 1), you begin Wave 2 with a slightly heavier load than what you used for the same rep count in Wave 1.

**Typical Rest Intervals**

- Rest 2 to 3 minutes between sets (or as needed to maintain performance).
- Due to the heavier nature of the loads, adequate rest is crucial.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

There is no specific stalling or plateau guidance provided in the JSON. Common practice is to reduce load increases or maintain load across waves if you fail to hit the target reps. If repeated plateaus occur, consider reducing overall volume or adding a light deload week.

### Example Application

> Wave 1: 6 reps at ~70%, 4 reps at ~80%, 2 reps at ~85%.  
> Wave 2: 6 reps at ~75%, 4 reps at ~85%, 2 reps at ~90%.

**Real-World Illustration (Squat Example for a 185 lb Intermediate)**  
Let’s assume a 1RM of ~315 lbs on the back squat.

- **Wave 1**
    
    - Set 1 (6 reps): 70% ≈ 220 lbs
    - Set 2 (4 reps): 80% ≈ 250 lbs
    - Set 3 (2 reps): 85% ≈ 270 lbs
- **Wave 2**
    
    - Set 4 (6 reps): 75% ≈ 235 lbs
    - Set 5 (4 reps): 85% ≈ 270 lbs
    - Set 6 (2 reps): 90% ≈ 285 lbs

**Progression Over Sessions**

- **Session 1**: Perform the above waves successfully.
- **Session 2**: Slightly increase each wave’s loading (e.g., +5 lbs for 6-rep sets, +5–10 lbs for 4-rep and 2-rep sets).
- **Session 3 & Onward**: Continue adding small increments if you hit all prescribed reps. If you fail, repeat or slightly reduce the increment the following session.

---

### Important Notes

> Focus on building both size and strength. Keep the number of waves to about two due to fatigue.

- Do not push beyond two waves if performance deteriorates.
- Keep form strict and avoid training to absolute failure.
- Autoregulate loading if needed: if you’re fatigued, reduce the planned increases or keep the same weight from the first wave in the second wave.

### Volume Metrics

> 2 waves x (6+4+2) = 24 total reps per exercise

By design, each exercise gets a total of 24 reps (6 sets × 4 average reps = 24). This keeps session volume moderate while still exposing you to heavy loads.

### Summary

Thibaudeau’s 6-4-2 Wave targets a balance of hypertrophy and strength, skewing heavier than higher-rep protocols. Ideal for intermediate to advanced lifters looking to push heavier weights but still accumulate enough volume for muscle growth. By gradually increasing loads across two consecutive waves, the lifter receives a potent stimulus without excessive volume or time commitment.
