## Overview and Execution
The Bulgarian Method Daily Max involves training the same lift daily and working up to a top single at approximately RPE 9. If you're feeling strong, you may push slightly above this intensity. Typically, the workout will include 1-2 back-off sets at around 90% of the day's max. This high-frequency method is primarily focused on squats and bench presses, utilizing daily waves and auto-regulation to guide intensity.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies
To mitigate stalling or burnout with this method, it is important to listen to your body and avoid grinding lifts daily. Deload as needed to ensure recovery and prevent long-term plateaus due to accumulated fatigue.

## Example Application
- **Day 1**: Perform daily squats, ramp up to a crisp single at 405 lbs, followed by 2 back-off sets of 2 reps at 365 lbs. 
- **Day 2**: Repeat or adjust based on previous day's performance and recoveryâ€”this auto-regulation allows for flexibility depending on daily readiness.

## Important Notes
This method is advanced and requires excellent recovery abilities. It is advisable not to train lifts to failure daily to avoid burnout. Monitoring your overall stress and ensuring adequate rest and nutrition is crucial for success with this program.

## Volume Metrics
The volume typically comprises approximately one top single daily, along with the necessary ramp sets leading to this maximal lift.

## Summary
The Bulgarian Method Daily Max is an advanced high-frequency strength training protocol best suited for experienced lifters with optimal recovery potential. This method aims to build maximal strength through frequent exposure to high-intensity lifts, particularly squats and bench presses. Due to its demands, caution is advised to avoid overtraining, and adapting the load based on daily readiness is encouraged to promote long-term progress.
