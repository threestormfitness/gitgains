### Overview and Execution

This setup calls for **3 reps every minute** using **70–75% of your 1RM**. You’ll complete 10 sets within 10 minutes, for a total of 30 reps. Focus on maintaining a moderate tempo and good form throughout each triple.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If the last sets become too difficult, keep the same weight for the next session until your form and bar speed are solid.
- If you consistently fail the last few sets, reduce the load by 5% and rebuild.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**: 10 x 3 at 150 lb.
- **Week 2**: If 150 lb felt manageable (no grinding), move to 155 lb.
- **Week 3**: Remain at 155 lb if the last sets are shaky, or increase to 160 lb if they were strong.

### Important Notes

- This module can be taxing because the total rep count is 30 at a moderately heavy load.
- Keep the 1-minute intervals strict to ensure you develop the intended work capacity.

### Volume Metrics

- **Total volume**: 10 × 3 = 30 reps.

### Summary

An effective blend of hypertrophy and strength emphasis, this EMOM is widely used in CrossFit settings. It builds proficiency at midrange percentages while promoting consistent, submaximal technique practice.
