  "overview_and_execution": "The Boring But Big (BBB) Ascending module consists of 5 sets of 10 reps, progressively increasing weight each set. Recommended percentages are 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, and 70% of Training Max (TM). Rest between sets is 60–120 seconds. The progression strategy involves increasing the top set weight over cycles. Cycle options include 30-50% in cycle one, 40-60% in cycle two, and 50-70% in cycle three, after which 70% becomes the new baseline. This method builds hypertrophy and work capacity with a controlled progression.",
  "example_application": "Week 1: 5x10 @ 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% TM. Week 2: Increase top set by 5 lbs. Week 3: Progress to next cycle, adjusting weight as needed.",
  "important_notes": "Start conservatively to manage fatigue. If 70% TM is too difficult for 10 reps, reduce it slightly. Superset pressing movements with lat work for efficiency. Avoid excessive fatigue in squats and deadlifts; modify if necessary.",
  "volume_metrics": "5 sets of 10 reps per exercise"
