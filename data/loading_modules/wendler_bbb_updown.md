## Overview and Execution
The Boring But Big (BBB) Up/Down module consists of 5 sets of 10 reps, following a wave-like intensity pattern. The recommended percentages for each set are as follows:

1. **Set 1** – 50% of Training Max (TM)
2. **Set 2** – 60% of TM
3. **Set 3** – 70% of TM
4. **Set 4** – 60% of TM
5. **Set 5** – 50% of TM

This structure allows for a peak intensity set in the middle while maintaining volume and managing fatigue. The rest intervals between sets should range from 60–120 seconds. The method is self-regulating as the Training Max (TM) increases over time.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies
- If you struggle to complete all 5 sets at the prescribed weights, reduce the top set by 5-10% TM.
- Increase rest between heavier sets to maintain output.
- If progression slows, reset to a lighter TM and rebuild.

## Example Application
For an intermediate lifter with a 1RM squat of 405 lbs:

- **Week 1:** 5x10 @ 205, 245, 285, 245, 205 lbs
- **Week 2:** Increase the top set by 5 lbs → 5x10 @ 205, 245, 290, 245, 205 lbs
- **Week 3:** Progress top set by another 5 lbs → 5x10 @ 205, 245, 295, 245, 205 lbs
- **Week 4:** Deload by reducing volume or lowering percentages

## Important Notes
- Start conservatively, especially for lower body lifts, as the high rep scheme can be fatiguing.
- Pressing movements can be supersetted with lat work to save time.
- If the 5x10 deadlift is too taxing, substitute good mornings or Romanian deadlifts.
- Avoid excessive volume beyond what’s programmed—fatigue management is crucial.

## Volume Metrics
- **Total Reps per Exercise:** 50 (5 sets x 10 reps)
- **Total Volume Load:** Adjusted based on TM percentages

## Summary
The BBB Up/Down module balances hypertrophy and strength endurance through an undulating intensity pattern. This structure is ideal for intermediate lifters looking to improve work capacity while managing fatigue across a high-volume training session. It self-regulates with Training Max adjustments, making it an effective long-term strategy for muscle and strength gains.
