## Overview and Execution

RIR Progression sets a fixed number of sets/reps (e.g., 4×10) with a target “Reps in Reserve” (RIR), commonly 2 RIR. If you finish sets with more than 2 RIR, it’s time to increase the weight.

- **Load Selection**: Pick a weight you can handle at 2 RIR for all sets.
- **Progression**: Once the exercise becomes easier (3+ RIR), add weight.
- **Regression**: If it’s too hard (≤1 RIR), reduce weight or reps.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: Drop to 8 reps or reduce sets for a week if you’re stuck.
- **Reset the Weight**: If your RIR is too low, step back and rebuild.

## Example Application

For a 185 lb lifter benching ~225 lb for 10 reps:

- **Week 1**: 4×10 at 205 lb, leaving ~2 RIR each set.
- **Week 2**: If on the 4th set you feel you still have 3+ reps left, move to 210 lb next session.
- **Ongoing**: Each time sets get easier than 2 RIR, bump weight 5–10 lb.

## Important Notes

- Success relies on accurately assessing RIR. Overestimation leads to under-loading; underestimation can cause overreach.
- Great for hypertrophy, general strength, and novices who prefer a simpler autoregulation system.

## Volume Metrics

Commonly ~4 sets × 10 reps = 40 total reps. Adjust sets/reps based on goals (e.g., 3×8 at 2 RIR).

## Summary

RIR Progression is an accessible autoregulation technique. By targeting a specific number of reps in reserve, you maintain consistent effort across sessions, increasing load only when you’re truly ready to handle more weight.
