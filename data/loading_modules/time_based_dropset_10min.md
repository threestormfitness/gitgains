### Module Details

| Field                          | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### Overview and Execution

Use a set time interval (30 seconds) instead of a rep count. Start with a challenging load for the first 30-second set, then immediately drop weight by 10–20% for another 30 seconds, then drop again for a final 30-second set. Rest 1–2 minutes if doing multiple rounds. Increase either the total time per set (e.g., 35 seconds) or the starting load once you can sustain a solid rep tempo across all intervals.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If rep speed or form degrades, try slightly decreasing the initial load.
- You could also add a fourth 30-second interval if you want more volume and the source suggests extra drops when progress stalls.

### Example Application

For a leg press:

- **Week 1**: 200 lb for 30s → drop to 180 lb for 30s → drop to 160 lb for 30s. Rest 1–2 min.
- **Week 2**: If you maintained consistent reps throughout, add 10 lb to the initial load or increase each interval to 35 seconds.

### Important Notes

Machine-based exercises are preferred for quick load changes. Maintain steady form and consistent tempo—avoid sloppy reps as you fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

You’ll complete 3 time-based segments (each 30 seconds). Usually repeated 2–3 times for a total of 6–9 intervals of work.

### Summary

Time-Based Drop Sets focus on continuous time under tension, helping build muscular endurance and hypertrophy. This is an excellent option for lifters wanting a clear, timed framework instead of rigid rep counts.
