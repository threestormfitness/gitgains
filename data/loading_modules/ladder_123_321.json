  "overview_and_execution": "Do 1 rep, rest, 2 reps, rest, 3 reps, rest, then repeat. Possibly up to 5 reps. This is one ladder. Do multiple ladders. Often used with limited rest to accumulate volume without burning out quickly.",
  "example_application": "Pull-ups: 1 rep, rest ~10s, 2 reps, rest, 3 reps, rest, repeat. If you can’t complete the top rung, reduce the max rung or total ladders.",
  "important_notes": "Excellent for practicing submax sets with cumulative volume. Great for skill-based lifts or bodyweight progressions.",
  "volume_metrics": "Each ladder rung total: 1+2+3=6 reps. Doing 3 ladders = 18 reps total, etc."
