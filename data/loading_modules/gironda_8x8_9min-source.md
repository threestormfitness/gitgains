### Source Material

IMPORTANT: when calculating parameters like time and metrics, ONLY base this off of one movement session (e.g., bench press or lat pulldown), NOT the entire workout.  I'm only interested in viewing this as a loading module (building block in a workout), not the entire workout.  If that doesn't make sense, please ask me before carrying this out

# 8x8 Loading Scheme

## Overview
The 8x8 method, developed by Vince Gironda, is a high-volume hypertrophy-focused loading scheme. It emphasizes muscle endurance, metabolic stress, and time under tension. This method is effective for body composition improvements, particularly when used strategically within a larger program.

## Execution
- Perform **8 sets of 8 reps** per exercise.
- Use **60-70% of 1RM** for load selection.
- Maintain **strict 30 seconds (or less) of rest** between sets.
- Primarily applied to **compound movements**, but can be used with select isolation exercises.
- Avoid failure; **reduce reps before reducing weight** if necessary.
- Gradually reduce rest times and increase loads over time.

## Considerations
- **Not strength-focused:** This method does not optimally develop maximal strength due to the moderate loads and high volume.
- **High metabolic demand:** Expect increased cardiovascular stress, especially with large compound lifts.
- **Progression Strategy:** Start with a load 30-40% below the true 8RM to ensure consistency.
- **Exercise Selection Matters:** Too many compound movements within the same session can be excessively fatiguing.

## Exercise Selection
### Recommended Movements
| Back | Chest | Legs | Shoulders | Arms |
|------|-------|------|-----------|------|
| Pull-ups | Flat/Incline Bench | Back Squat | Seated DB Shoulder Press | Triceps Pressdown |
| Lat Pulldown | Cable Chest Press | Leg Extension | Standing BB Shoulder Press | Close-Grip Bench |
| Seated Row | DB Bench Press | Leg Press | Push Press | Floor Press |
| T-Bar Row | Blast Strap Push-up | Hamstring Curl | DB Upright Row | BB/DB/Zottman Curl* |
| DB Chest Supported Row | | Calf Raise | Chest Supported Fly | Chin-up |
| | | | | French Press |

(*Zottman curls performed bilaterally, not one arm at a time.)

### Exercises to Avoid
- **Deadlift, Bent-over Row, Good Morning:** Excessive spinal loading under high volume/rest constraints.
- **Front Squat:** Rhomboid fatigue limits effectiveness beyond six reps.
- **Unilateral Movements:** Breaks the flow of minimal rest intervals.

## Key Guidelines
- **Use progressively shorter rest periods** to enhance conditioning.
- **Prioritize compound lifts** but recognize limitations of stabilizing muscles.
- **Avoid excessive volume in a single session**—limit high-intensity compounds within an 8x8 framework.
- **Adapt for integration into mixed-method training**—works well as an assistance protocol alongside strength-based approaches like 5/3/1 or Conjugate Method.

## Summary
The 8x8 method is a highly effective hypertrophy tool when used appropriately. It enhances muscular endurance, increases metabolic stress, and promotes lean mass gains when implemented within a well-structured program.
