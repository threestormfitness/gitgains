## Overview and Execution

The GZCL Method is structured into three tiers, each focusing on different intensities, rep ranges, and exercises:

- **Tier 1 (T1)**: Main heavy lift performed for 1-5 reps, focusing on compound movements at approximately 80-90% intensity. The total target is 10-15 reps.
- **Tier 2 (T2)**: Secondary lifts performed for 6-10 reps at 65-75% intensity. The target total is 20-30 reps. 
- **Tier 3 (T3)**: Accessory and more general work done for 10-20 reps at 50-65% intensity. Aim for 30+ total reps.

Each tier targets a specific volume, and progression can be made by increasing weight or reps once consistently reaching the rep target.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

To address plateaus:

- **Tier rationalization**: Ensure each lift falls within its prescribed tier and intensity.
- **Adjust volume**: If consistently failing rep goals, consider adjusting volume before intensity.
- **Deload**: Every few cycles, implement a deload week to allow for recovery.

## Example Application

For a sample squat-focused session:

- **T1**: Squat 3×3 with a heavy load.
- **T2**: Front squat 3×8 at a moderate intensity.
- **T3**: Lunges 3×12 for higher reps. 

Aim to hit the volume goals in each tier before considering load increases.

## Important Notes

- This program is excellent for building strength and size, offering flexibility in exercise choice.
- Consistently track your rep goals per tier and progress systematically.
- It's important not to train to failure; keep 1-2 reps in reserve for Tier 1 and Tier 2, and Tier 3 can be pushed further.

## Volume Metrics

- **Tier 1**: Approximately 10-15 total reps
- **Tier 2**: Approximately 20-30 total reps
- **Tier 3**: 30+ total reps

## Summary

The GZCL Method, developed by Cody LeFever, is ideal for lifters looking to balance strength and hypertrophy in a flexible format. It is suitable for intermediate lifters who want a structured yet adaptable program to improve overall performance through careful autoregulation and strategic volume distribution.
