### Overview and Execution

Pick a single moderate-to-heavy weight. Start with the most challenging position or grip, performing 6–8 reps. Without resting, shift to a stronger position (slightly narrower or more neutral grip) and go to failure. Finally, shift to your strongest position (often the narrowest or most mechanically efficient) and do as many reps as possible. Once you comfortably exceed 8 reps in the weakest position, increase the overall load.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you plateau, consider adding a fourth position (if applicable) or adding partial reps at the final strongest position.
- You can also slightly lengthen rest intervals (10–15 seconds) between transitions, but the classic approach uses minimal rest.

### Example Application

- **Week 1**:
    
    - **Biceps**:
        1. Wide-grip barbell curls × 6 reps
        2. Narrower standard grip to failure
        3. Close grip to failure
    - 1–2 minutes rest, then repeat for another round if desired.
- **Week 2+**:
    
    - If you hit 8+ reps on the wide-grip, bump your starting weight by 5 lb.

### Important Notes

Keep transitions quick. Use good form throughout, especially as you fatigue in later grips. This is a highly fatiguing method for targeted muscle groups, so factor in adequate recovery.

### Volume Metrics

Three “phases” each round (weak → standard → strongest). You might do 1–2 rounds per exercise.

### Summary

Mechanical Advantage Drop Sets let you continue pushing a muscle group without changing the weight, leveraging progressively stronger mechanical positions. Great for variety and hypertrophy, but be mindful of recovery due to the high fatigue nature.
