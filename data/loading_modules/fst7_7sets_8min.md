## Overview and Execution

The FST-7 module is a bodybuilding approach focused on maximizing muscle pump and fascia stretching. To execute this module, choose an isolation exercise to perform as a finisher. You will complete 7 sets with 8 to 12 repetitions. Rest intervals are kept short, between 30 to 45 seconds, to enhance the pump and tension within the muscle. During rest periods, incorporate brief flexing or stretching of the worked muscles to further enhance effectiveness.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

This module does not specifically cover strategies for addressing plateaus or stalling, as it is designed primarily as a high-intensity finisher for hypertrophy and pump, rather than a progressive overload system.

## Example Application

For instance, using leg extensions as your chosen exercise, perform 7 sets of 10 repetitions at 100 lbs, with approximately 40 seconds of rest between each set. Between sets, take the opportunity to pose or stretch your quads to increase muscle fiber activation and pump.

## Important Notes

- Stay hydrated, as the rest periods are minimal and may lead to increased perspiration.
- This exercise is typically done at the end of a workout to maximize its hypertrophy benefits as a ‘finishing’ effect.
- The main intention of this module is to achieve a deep muscle pump, contributing to muscle growth.

## Volume Metrics

- Total Sets: 7
- Total Reps: Approximately 70 total repetitions (7 sets × ~10 reps)

## Summary

The FST-7 is a specialized module by Hany Rambod, aimed at those looking to achieve significant muscle pump and hypertrophy enhancements in the context of a bodybuilding regimen. This module is particularly suited for intermediate to advanced trainees as an exercise finisher, leveraging short rest periods and high-intensity sets. It is efficient, lasting around 8 minutes per session, and is not designed for continuous cycles but rather for specific hypertrophic purposes.
