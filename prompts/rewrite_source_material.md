You have the following task:

1. **Input**: A block of source text (article, blog post, training notes, etc.) describing one or more “loading modules” (i.e., set-rep schemes, wave loading methods, progression structures, etc.).

2. **Goal**: 
   - **Parse** the source text to identify *each distinct loading module* mentioned (e.g., “7-5-3 waves,” “6-4-2 waves,” “5-3-1 waves,” “3-2-1 waves,” “2-2-1 waves,” or any special “block” or “pendulum” approach).
   - **Rewrite** each module as an **independent, self-contained “loading module page”** in Markdown format, using a clear, concise style—**minimal fluff**, just the essential how-to details and rationale.

3. **Output**: 
   - For *each* loading module you find, produce a **Markdown** section with:
     1. **Main Heading** (e.g., “# 3-2-1 Wave Loading”)  
     2. **Overview**  
        - Brief explanation of the module’s purpose and how it works.
     3. **Structure** (or “How It Works”)  
        - Clearly lay out set/rep patterns, progression logic, wave structure, etc.
     4. **Load Selection Guidelines**  
        - How to choose starting weights, progression tips, or any percentage guidelines (if applicable).
     5. **Rest Intervals**  
        - Typical or recommended rest times and any notes on adjusting them.
     6. **Execution / Key Considerations**  
        - Points about when to use it, who it’s best for, or cautionary notes (e.g., fatigue, technique).
     7. **Summary** (or “Wrap-Up”)  
        - 1–2 paragraph synopsis of why/when to use the module.
     8. **Source Reference** (optional)  
        - A single line acknowledging the original text/link, if desired.

4. **Important**:
   - **Ignore non-essential fluff** (e.g., personal anecdotes, extended background commentary) unless it’s crucial to understanding the method.
   - **Focus on practical, concise instructions** that let someone pick up the module and apply it right away.
   - If the text mentions multiple rep schemes under one umbrella (e.g., “wave loading” variations), treat *each variation* as a **separate** loading module, unless they’re clearly grouped as one single method.
   - If something is unclear or missing, make a note or add a short assumption. Do not invent new data.

5. **Example**:
   - A reference for tone/structure is the “3-2-1 Wave Loading” example you provided:
     ```
     # 3-2-1 Wave Loading
     
     ## Overview
     ...
     
     ## Structure
     1. Set 1: 3 reps @ ~85% ...
     2. Set 2: 2 reps ...
     3. ...
     ...
     
     ## Load Selection Guidelines
     ...
     
     ## Rest Intervals
     ...
     
     ## Execution Considerations
     ...
     
     ## Summary
     ...
     
     ## Source
     [Link or short note]
     ```

**Steps to Follow**:
1. **Paste** or **provide** the source text after this prompt template.
2. **Run** the query.
3. **Receive** a set of Markdown write-ups—one for each loading module identified.

That’s it! Please create the final MD output accordingly.
