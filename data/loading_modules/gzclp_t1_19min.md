### Overview and Execution

GZCLP Tier 1 involves heavy barbell lifts (Squat, Bench, Deadlift, Overhead Press) performed in a wave-like progression. You begin with **5×3+** (last set AMRAP) and add weight each session until failing the “base volume” of 15 total reps. Once you can’t complete 15, drop to **6×2+**. Continue until failing the new base (12 reps). Then move to **10×1+** until failing 10 reps. After this final stage, rest a couple of days, test a new 5RM, and restart at ~85% of that new 5RM. The last set is typically an AMRAP but avoid grinding out to true failure—aim to leave 1–2 reps in the tank.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- When you cannot reach the required “base volume” (15, 12, or 10 total reps), **switch** to the next wave (3→2→1 reps per set).
- After failing at 10×1+, you **deload** by testing a new 5RM and restarting the cycle at about 85% of that value.

### Example Application

Suppose a 185 lb lifter starts Squat T1 at **185 lb** for 5×3+. Each session, they add **10 lb** and attempt 5×3. Once they can’t reach 15 total reps, they switch to 6×2+ with that same top weight and continue adding 10 lb each new session until failing 12 reps total. They then move to 10×1+ and keep increasing by 10 lb until they fail to hit 10 singles. At that point, they rest a few days, test a new 5RM, and resume at ~85% of that tested max.

### Important Notes

- **Don’t** push AMRAP sets much beyond ~10 reps; keep 1–2 reps in reserve.
- Once you miss the target base volume, drop to the next rep wave.
- Prioritize form and adequate rest (3–5 minutes) between sets.

### Volume Metrics

Depending on where you are in the wave:

- **5×3:** 15 total reps
- **6×2:** 12 total reps
- **10×1:** 10 total reps

### Summary

GZCLP Tier 1 is designed for **novice to intermediate lifters** seeking a structured approach to extend linear progress. It uses wave loading to sustain gains longer than a simple 5×5 or 3×5. The tier resets after each fail point, providing a built-in progression and deload strategy.
