### Overview and Execution

Start at ~80% 1RM for 6 reps, rest ~15 seconds, increase weight slightly (2–3%) for 5 reps, rest ~15 seconds, and keep increasing as reps decrease—down to 1 rep at ~90% 1RM. After one full wave (6-5-4-3-2-1), you can rest 2–3 minutes and optionally do a second wave with slightly heavier loads or the same load if near max effort.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail a rep in the middle of a wave, reduce the load for subsequent mini-sets or skip the last set of the wave.
- Gradually micro-load if jumps are too large.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a 315 lb squat 1RM:

- **Wave 1**: 6 reps @ 250 lbs (~80%), rest 15s, 5 reps @ 255 lbs, rest 15s, 4 reps @ 260 lbs, rest 15s, 3 reps @ 265 lbs, rest 15s, 2 reps @ 270 lbs, rest 15s, 1 rep @ 275 lbs.
- Rest 2–3 minutes, then attempt a second wave with slightly heavier loads if you had more in the tank.

### Important Notes

- This technique is advanced; wave loading can be taxing on the CNS.
- Short rests are integral to keep tension high.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**, generally 21 total reps per wave (6+5+4+3+2+1). One or two waves is typical.

### Summary

6–1 wave loading with rest-pause brings a broad range of rep targets into one extended sequence, tapping into both strength and hypertrophy. It’s well-suited for experienced lifters looking for variety and a challenging, time-efficient protocol.
