## The Block Approach (Wave Loading)

### Overview
A “block” approach to wave loading means sticking with one wave scheme (e.g., 7-5-3, 5-3-1, etc.) for several consecutive weeks before moving to a new scheme. This creates focused progression blocks where you can adapt to one pattern before shifting to another.

### Structure
- **Block 1 (Weeks 1–4)**: Use one scheme (e.g., 7-5-3).  
- **Block 2 (Weeks 5–8)**: Switch to a different scheme (e.g., 5-3-1).  
- **Block 3 (Weeks 9–11)**: Move to a lower-rep scheme (e.g., 3-2-1).

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Start each block on the conservative side for the first week, allowing progressive overload over 3–4 weeks.  
- Move to a heavier or lower-rep scheme as you advance to the next block.

### Rest Intervals
- Follow standard wave loading rest recommendations (90–180 seconds).  
- Adjust as needed for each block, especially as reps get lower and loads get heavier.

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Excellent for lifters who thrive on steady progression and adaptation to a single pattern before rotating.  
- Blocks typically last 3–4 weeks, giving your body time to adapt to a particular wave scheme.  
- Useful for structured periodization or peaking cycles.

### Summary
A block-based wave loading plan allows you to systematically progress from higher-rep waves to lower-rep waves, building muscle size first and then transitioning to heavier strength work. This helps avoid boredom and manages fatigue across training phases.
