### Overview and Execution

With ~85% 1RM on the bar, do 5 reps, rest 20s, then 3 reps, rest 20s, then 2 reps. That completes one cluster set. Rest 2–3 minutes, then repeat for a total of 3 such cluster sets. Increase weight by 2.5–5 lbs once you can cleanly hit all reps each cluster.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you fail any reps in the sequence, increase intra-set rest to 30s or reduce load by ~5% until you adapt.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a 365 lb deadlift 1RM:

- Start at ~310 lbs (85%). Perform 5 reps, rest 20s, do 3 reps, rest 20s, do 2 reps. Rest 3 min. Repeat twice more.
- If you complete all reps over 3 clusters, move to 315 lbs next time.

### Important Notes

- Short rests allow decent recovery while keeping intensity high.
- Good for moderate-volume, high-intensity strength training.

### Volume Metrics

- **3 sets** × (5+3+2) = **30 total reps** if all are completed.

### Summary

5–3–2 cluster sets deliver a descending rep scheme in short bursts. Great for intermediate lifters seeking high-intensity work without the burnout of longer continuous sets.
