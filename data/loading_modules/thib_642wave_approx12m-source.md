## 6-4-2 Wave Loading

### Overview
Similar to 7-5-3, the 6-4-2 wave loading scheme targets both hypertrophy and strength. The slightly lower reps (6, 4, and 2) shift the focus more toward heavier loads, making it slightly more strength-oriented than 7-5-3 while still providing a decent hypertrophy stimulus.

### Structure
- **Wave 1**  
  1. Set 1: 6 reps (moderate load)  
  2. Set 2: 4 reps (increase load)  
  3. Set 3: 2 reps (increase load further)
- **Wave 2**  
  1. Set 4: 6 reps (heavier than Set 1)  
  2. Set 5: 4 reps (heavier than Set 2)  
  3. Set 6: 2 reps (heavier than Set 3)

Perform 1–2 waves as tolerated.

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Keep the first wave conservative, using the 6-rep set to “ramp up.”  
- For the second wave, start your 6-rep set around the weight you used for the 4-rep set in Wave 1, then go heavier for 4 and 2 reps.

### Rest Intervals
- Rest 90–180 seconds between sets.  
- Potentially increase rest on the second wave if you feel too fatigued.

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Good choice for a balanced approach to building strength and size, leaning slightly more toward heavier lifting.  
- Stop adding waves if form deteriorates or if you fail to increase the load as planned.

### Summary
Choose 6-4-2 waves when you want a middle ground between higher-rep hypertrophy and low-rep strength. The incremental load increases each set, and the second wave challenges you to beat your initial numbers.
