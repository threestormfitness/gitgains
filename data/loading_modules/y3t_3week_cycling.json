  "overview_and_execution": "Week1: heavier loads, 6-10 reps. Week2: moderate loads, 10-14 reps. Week3: lighter loads, 20+ reps. This cycles hypertrophy stimuli to shock growth. Then repeat.",
  "example_application": "Legs: W1 (6-10), W2(10-14), W3(20-25). Adjust loads so you approach failure in each range.",
  "important_notes": "Intense. Variation in rep ranges helps overall hypertrophy. Each cycle is 3 weeks, then you can repeat with heavier loads.",
  "volume_metrics": "Total sets depends on exercise selection and intensities each week"
