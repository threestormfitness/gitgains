## Overview and Execution

To execute Myo-Reps, choose a weight you can lift for 10-20 reps for the initial activation set, aiming to reach near failure around RPE 8-9 (approximately 60-75% of your 1RM). After completing the activation set, rest for about 10 seconds, then perform mini-sets of 3-5 reps. Continue performing mini-sets with 10-second rests until the speed of your reps decreases notably or until you can no longer complete the mini-set rep ranges. Record the total number of reps achieved across the activation and mini-sets to monitor progress.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you encounter a plateau or notice that you cannot maintain the rep ranges in successive sessions, consider adjusting your load slightly downwards for a session to allow for recovery and then progress slowly back up. Tracking your mini-set rep speed can also help identify when to adjust intensity or rest periods.

## Example Application

Consider a chest press machine workout:
- **Activation Set**: Perform 15 repetitions.
- **Mini-Sets**: Rest for 10 seconds, perform 5 reps; rest for another 10 seconds, perform 4 reps; repeat 4 reps, then finish with 3 reps, stopping if the rep velocity decreases significantly.

Continue with this pattern until the total number of reps over multiple sessions is improved.

## Important Notes

This module is especially beneficial for hypertrophy with minimal volume involvement. Utilize primarily with machine exercises or stable movements to minimize injury risk. Focus on tracking total reps and seek to gradually increase the total number of reps over repeated sessions.

## Volume Metrics

A single extended set can lead to a total of 20-30 reps, depending on activation set performance and the number of mini-sets achieved before reaching the threshold for dropping off.

## Summary

Myo-Reps provides a streamlined approach to strength training with a focus on hypertrophy without excessive volume. It is particularly useful for those seeking an efficient workout strategy and is suitable for intermediate to advanced trainees mindful of monitoring exertion levels. Always ensure proper execution to avoid excessive strain, particularly during mini-sets close to failure.
