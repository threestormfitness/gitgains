### Overview and Execution

Tier 2 in GZCLP provides additional volume at **moderate intensities**. You start with **3×10** and add a little weight each session (e.g., 5 lb upper, 10 lb lower). Once you can’t complete **30 reps** total, switch to **3×8** and repeat. After you stall on **24 reps** total, drop to **3×6**. When you fail to meet **18 reps**, restart the cycle (back at 3×10) with a slightly heavier starting weight than before.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you miss the target total reps (30, 24, or 18), move down to the next rep bracket (10 → 8 → 6).
- Once you fail 3×6, reset to 3×10 with a modest weight increase.

### Example Application

An intermediate lifter might run **T2 Bench** at 135 lb for 3×10. Each T2 session, add 5 lb (140, 145, etc.). If they fail to hit 30 total reps, they move to 3×8 at that weight. After they fail at 24 total reps, they drop to 3×6, keep adding 5 lb each session until failing 18 total reps, then reset.

### Important Notes

- Use **2–3 minutes** rest between sets to maintain form.
- Once you stall, reduce reps and keep progressing weight.
- This approach provides volume to support your T1 lifts.

### Volume Metrics

- Range is typically **3×10** (30 reps) → **3×8** (24 reps) → **3×6** (18 reps).

### Summary

GZCLP Tier 2 is a **secondary loading module** aimed at building volume and supporting the primary lifts. By gradually lowering the rep range each time you stall, you maximize progression while giving yourself a clear fallback plan when sets become too challenging.
