  "overview_and_execution": "Start at Step 1 and perform 1 pullup, 2 pushups, and 3 situps. Progressively increase the reps as you ascend the pyramid, multiplying the step number by 1 for pullups, 2 for pushups, and 3 for situps until reaching Step 10 (10 pullups, 20 pushups, 30 situps). After a 1-minute rest at the peak, descend the pyramid by reducing the reps in reverse order until you return to Step 1.",
  "example_application": "An intermediate trainee completes the full pyramid: 1-10 steps ascending and 9-1 steps descending, totaling 100 pullups, 200 pushups, and 300 situps in the session.",
  "important_notes": "Perform no more than twice a week to avoid overtraining. Modify difficulty using TRX for assistance or additional resistance. Ensure minimal rest between exercises to maintain endurance benefits.",
  "volume_metrics": "Total volume per session: 100 pullups, 200 pushups, 300 situps."
