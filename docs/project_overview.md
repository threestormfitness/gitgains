# GitGains Project Overview

## Introduction

GitGains is more than just a repository - it's a bridge between human exercise knowledge and AI-assisted programming. By providing structured data and documentation that captures both scientific research and real-world experience, GitGains enables anyone to leverage AI for creating effective training programs.

## Philosophy

GitGains embraces a "big tent" approach to exercise programming knowledge:
- **Evidence-Based Practice**: Research findings and peer-reviewed studies
- **Field-Tested Methods**: Real-world experience from coaches and athletes
- **Practical Programming**: Time-tested approaches from the trenches
- **Novel Approaches**: Innovative training methodologies

Our goal is not to judge or validate training approaches, but to structure and document them in a way that makes them accessible and actionable through AI.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Structure (`/data`)

#### Loading Modules
- JSON files defining set/rep schemes, progression patterns
- Markdown documentation explaining implementation
- Source documentation for attribution and context
- Examples: Linear progression, wave loading, cluster sets

#### Movement Library
- Exercise definitions and classifications
- Substitution options for different equipment/environments
- Joint-friendly variations
- Movement pattern relationships

#### Master Lists
- Training variables and taxonomies
- Equipment classifications
- Movement patterns
- Programming terminology

#### Programs
- Template programs
- Example implementations
- Case studies

### 2. AI Integration (`/prompts`)

- Example prompts for various LLM platforms
- Templates for program generation
- Query patterns for knowledge base exploration
- Conversation flows for program modification

### 3. Automation Tools (`/scripts`)

#### Local Database Tools
- Scripts for building SQLite databases
- JSON processing utilities
- Data validation tools
- Custom database schema examples

#### AI Integration Scripts
- OpenAI API integration examples
- Custom LLM workflow templates
- Batch processing tools
- Program generation automation

## Data Format Standards

### Loading Module Structure
Each loading module consists of:
1. JSON file: Technical parameters and variables
2. Main MD file: Implementation details and guidelines
3. Source MD file: Background, attribution, and context

### Exercise Definitions
- Primary movement patterns
- Joint actions
- Equipment requirements
- Progression/regression paths
- Substitution options

## Use Cases

1. **AI-Assisted Program Design**
   - Feed structured data to LLMs
   - Generate customized programs
   - Validate exercise selection
   - Optimize progression patterns

2. **Knowledge Base Exploration**
   - Search for specific training methods
   - Explore exercise variations
   - Understand programming patterns
   - Find substitution options

3. **Local Tools Development**
   - Build personal exercise databases
   - Create custom AI workflows
   - Automate program generation
   - Process and analyze training data
