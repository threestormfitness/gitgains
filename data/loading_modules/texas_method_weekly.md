## Overview and Execution

This module spans a weekly cycle aimed at intermediate lifters transitioning from linear progression models. The week is structured as follows:

- **Monday (Volume Day)**: Perform 5 sets of 5 reps (5×5) at approximately 85-90% of your 5RM. This session focuses on building strength through increased volume.
- **Wednesday**: Engage in a lighter recovery session to facilitate recovery.
- **Friday (Intensity Day)**: Ramp up to a new 5RM with 1 set of 5 reps (1×5) at 100% 5RM. The goal is to surpass last week’s intensity.

Progression is encouraged by increasing weight every week if possible.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

While specific strategies for stalling aren't directly mentioned, it's implied that every few weeks, a deload phase should be incorporated if progression stalls.

## Example Application

The following example demonstrates how this program might unfold:

- **Week 1**:
  - Monday: 5×5 at 300 lbs
  - Friday: 1×5 at 320 lbs

- **Week 2**:
  - Monday: 5×5 at 300 lbs
  - Friday: 1×5 at 325 lbs

This approach provides a clear framework where volume remains constant while the intensity increases incrementally on intensity days.

## Important Notes

- This module is specifically suited for intermediate lifters who need a methodical approach to breaking through plateaus often encountered after the novice training stage.
- Volume day should not lead to failure; reserve at least one rep in the tank to prevent overtraining and ensure longevity of gains.

## Volume Metrics

- **Volume Day**: Totaling 25 reps (5 sets of 5 reps).
- **Intensity Day**: Totaling 5 reps (1 set of 5 reps).

## Summary

The Texas Method Weekly module, as crafted by Mark Rippetoe, provides an excellent bridge for lifters ready to move from simple linear progression to a more nuanced routine targeting both volume and intensity within a single week. It is particularly beneficial for intermediates needing a structured approach to overcome the stagnation that typically accompanies initial strength gains. Adherence to proper progression and form, alongside strategic deloads, can facilitate continued strength development and pave the way for advanced training phases.
