## Overview and Execution

The APRE 3RM module features four main sets, using a true 3RM (a weight where you can perform exactly three reps before failure). The session unfolds as follows:

- **Set 1**: ~50% of your 3RM for 6 reps  
- **Set 2**: ~75% of your 3RM for 3 reps  
- **Set 3**: AMRAP (as many reps as possible) at your current 3RM load  
- **Set 4**: Adjust the weight according to how Set 3 felt or how many reps you achieved

Rest periods scale with intensity and load:
- 1–2 minutes after lighter sets (Sets 1–2)
- 3–5 minutes after heavier sets (Sets 3–4)

This design autoregulates training load. You assess your performance each session and adjust the next session’s 3RM load based on how many reps you achieved in Set 3.

### Performance-to-Load Adjustment Chart

Use the following chart to guide your load for the **next** session:

| **Reps in Set 3** | **Next Session Adjustment** |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1–2 reps          | Decrease 5–10 lb           |
| 3–4 reps          | Keep the same weight       |
| 5–6 reps          | Increase 5–10 lb           |
| 7+ reps           | Increase 10–15 lb          |

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you chronically hit only 1–2 reps in Set 3 for several consecutive sessions, consider:
- Reducing your base 3RM weight more substantially
- Adding an extra rest day
- Reviewing technique and recovery factors (sleep, nutrition)
- Lowering accessory volume to prioritize recovery

## Example Application

Consider a 185 lb lifter with the following starting 3RMs:
- **Back Squat**: 280 lb
- **Bench Press**: 225 lb
- **Deadlift**: 330 lb

A weekly approach might look like this (showing progression for Back Squat):

**Session 1**  
- Set 1: 6 reps @ ~140 lb (50% of 280)  
- Set 2: 3 reps @ ~210 lb (75% of 280)  
- Set 3: AMRAP @ 280 lb — Suppose 5 reps  
- Set 4: Repeat a heavy triple at ~280–290 lb as you adjust to the new load.  

Next session’s **3RM** increases by 5–10 lb because 5 reps were achieved in Set 3.

**Session 2** (new 3RM ~285 lb)  
- Set 1: 6 reps @ ~140–145 lb  
- Set 2: 3 reps @ ~215 lb  
- Set 3: AMRAP @ 285 lb  
- Set 4: Adjust according to performance  

This pattern continues, adjusting your 3RM weight every session based on the AMRAP result. The bench press and deadlift follow the same template with their respective 3RMs.

## Important Notes

- Begin with a **true 3RM**—test or carefully estimate a weight you can only manage for 3 solid reps.  
- Prioritize **explosive and high-quality** reps rather than grinding out poor form.  
- This program **heavily taxes the nervous system** and is best suited for lifters who already have a strong training foundation.  
- Continuous load adjustments help avoid the need for frequent deloads.

## Volume Metrics

Each main exercise involves four total sets:
- Approximately **6 + 3 + (3–7) + 3** reps per session, though Set 3 can vary widely based on performance.

## Summary

Thomas DeLorme’s APRE 3RM module is a highly effective, autoregulated approach for advanced lifters seeking maximal strength gains. By dynamically adjusting the load after an AMRAP set, it ensures continuous progress without arbitrary weight jumps. This makes it a great choice for powerlifters, strength athletes, and anyone looking to push their 1RM higher through focused, high-intensity training.
