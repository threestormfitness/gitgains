## Overview and Execution

The RPE-Based Top Set with Backoff Sets approach involves selecting a single “top set” at RPE 8 (meaning you should have about 2 reps left in the tank). After that top set, you perform multiple backoff sets—typically at about 90% of the weight used in your top set—for the same rep count.

- **Progression**: If your top set felt like RPE 7.5 or lower, add a small amount of weight (2.5–5 lb) next session.
- **If Overly Challenging**: If the top set is above RPE 8, hold the weight steady until it becomes easier.
- **Deload**: Lower the target RPE or change the rep range to reduce intensity and volume temporarily when needed.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Deload**: If the RPE is creeping above 8 for multiple sessions, drop your top set RPE target to 7 for a week or change your rep scheme (e.g., move from sets of 5 to sets of 4).
- **Focus on Technique**: During a plateau, ensure your form is solid at slightly lower intensities before ramping back up.

## Example Application

For an intermediate 185 lb lifter whose squat 1RM is around 315 lb:

- **Week 1**: Top set of 5 reps at 235 lb (RPE 8). Four backoff sets at ~210–215 lb.
- **Week 2**: If Week 1 felt manageable (RPE ~7.5), increase top set to 240 lb, backoffs at ~215–220 lb.
- **Week 3**: If top set starts to feel like RPE 8.5, hold that weight until it’s back to RPE 8 or lower.
- **Week 4**: If progression stalls, deload by reducing top set weight to an RPE 7 or moving to 4-rep sets.

## Important Notes

- Be honest with RPE. Overestimating or underestimating can skew progression.
- Adjust rest times as needed (2–3 minutes for top sets, 1–2 minutes for backoffs) to keep quality high.

## Volume Metrics

With a single top set plus four backoff sets of 5, total volume is 5×5 = 25 reps. This remains relatively constant across sessions (unless you change rep count or add sets).

## Summary

“RPE-Based Top Set with Backoff Sets” is a flexible, autoregulated module. It provides both a heavy stimulus from the top set and volume stimulus from backoffs. Ideal for novice to advanced lifters who want day-to-day tuning of intensity while maintaining consistency in volume.
