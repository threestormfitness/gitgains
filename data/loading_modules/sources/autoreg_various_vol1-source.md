# 1. RPE-Based Top Set with Backoff Sets

## Overview

This method uses the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) to select a challenging top set, then follows up with multiple backoff sets at a reduced weight. It helps regulate intensity based on daily performance.

## Structure

1. **Top Set**: Perform 1 set of a chosen rep target (e.g., 5 reps) at an RPE 8. (RPE 8 = ~2 reps in reserve.)
2. **Backoff Sets**: Perform 3–5 additional sets of the same rep target at ~90% of the top set’s weight.

### Example

- **Top Set**: 5 reps at RPE 8
- **Backoff Sets**: 4 sets of 5 reps at 90% of your top-set weight

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Warm up in a few sets, gradually increasing weight until you reach your target RPE for the top set.
- If you hit an RPE 7.5 or lower on the top set, add 2.5–5 lb next session.
- If RPE is above 8, keep the same weight until it feels easier (i.e., RPE decreases).

## Rest Intervals

- Rest 2–3 minutes between top set attempts to ensure proper recovery.
- For backoff sets, 1–2 minutes may suffice, but extend rest if needed to maintain form.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Focus on consistent technique. RPE-based training can be subjective; be honest about how many reps you have left in the tank.
- This module is versatile for squats, bench press, deadlifts, or any main lift.

## Summary

RPE-Based Top Set with Backoff Sets offers a flexible approach: you push yourself in a single heavier set, then accumulate volume with manageable backoff work. It’s beginner-friendly yet scales well for advanced lifters.

# 2. Daily Max Training (Bulgarian Method Adaptation)

## Overview

Inspired by the Bulgarian Olympic weightlifting approach, this module involves working up to a heavy single (a “daily max”) frequently, but not necessarily a true 1RM. After hitting that max, you do a few lower-volume backoff sets.

## Structure

1. **Daily Max**: Work up to a single rep at about RPE 9 (a tough single without grinding).
2. **Backoff Sets**: Perform 2–3 sets of 2–3 reps at 85–90% of that day’s max.

### Example

- **Daily Max**: Single @ RPE 9
- **Backoff**: 2 sets of 2 reps at ~90% of the daily max

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Gradually add weight through warm-up sets until you reach a single that feels like you could maybe do one more rep.
- Increase the max if it feels easier than RPE 9.

## Rest Intervals

- For the daily max attempts, rest 3–5 minutes between heavier warm-up singles.
- For backoff sets, rest 2–3 minutes, or until recovered enough to maintain performance.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Typically done very frequently (up to daily), but if you’re new, start with 3–4 sessions per week.
- Monitor fatigue closely; if sessions become too draining, reduce frequency or add a lighter/speed day.

## Summary

Daily Max Training emphasizes frequent heavy work to build comfort with heavier loads. It’s best for experienced lifters or those who can closely monitor recovery and maintain technique at high intensity.

## Source Reference

Inspired by John Broz’s adaptation of the Bulgarian weightlifting system.

# 3. Velocity-Based Training (VBT)

## Overview

VBT uses a device or app to measure bar speed, stopping sets or adjusting load once speed drops below a certain threshold. It’s a modern autoregulation method common in sports performance training.

## Structure

1. **Target Velocity**: Choose a velocity zone (e.g., 0.6 m/s) based on your training goal (strength, power, or speed).
2. **Work Sets**: Perform sets of 3–5 reps, stopping the set when the bar speed falls below 0.6 m/s (or your target).

### Example

- **Work**: 3 reps per set, tracking each rep’s velocity.
- End the set if velocity drops under 0.6 m/s or you complete the planned reps while staying above it.

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Start with a moderate weight and monitor your first set’s bar speed.
- If your speed stays consistently above target for all reps, increase the load.
- If speed drops too quickly, lower the weight or reduce reps.

## Rest Intervals

- Rest long enough (2–3 minutes) to recover speed performance.
- Use velocity feedback to gauge if you’re adequately rested before the next set.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Requires a velocity tracking tool (e.g., a bar-mounted sensor, camera app, or gym device).
- Excellent for athletes or anyone wanting precise feedback on fatigue and power output.
- Novices can still benefit by monitoring consistent bar speed, but the equipment requirement can be a barrier.

## Summary

VBT tailors load and volume to real-time performance, making your training more precise and less reliant on guesswork. It’s ideal for those seeking to improve power and manage fatigue effectively.

# 4. Autoregulatory Progressive Volume (APV)

## Overview

APV adjusts the total number of sets in a session based on how you feel and perform. Start with a baseline number of sets, and if you’re still below a certain RPE, you keep adding sets until you reach your target RPE.

## Structure

1. **Baseline Sets**: Begin with a target rep count (e.g., 8 reps) at an RPE around 7 (fairly moderate).
2. **Add Sets**: After each set, if RPE remains at 7, add another set.
3. **Stop Adding**: When you hit an RPE of 8 (or your target), stop adding sets.

### Example

- **Start**: 3 sets of 8 @ RPE 7.
- If the third set is still @ RPE 7, do a fourth set.
- Continue until you reach RPE 8.

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Pick a weight you can handle at RPE 7 for about 8 reps.
- Increase load when you can complete multiple sets at RPE 7 or below.

## Rest Intervals

- Use 1–2 minutes rest between sets, adjusting if you need slightly more to keep form.
- If your RPE jumps quickly set to set, extend rest or reduce load.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Ideal for hypertrophy or general strength since volume can adjust to daily readiness.
- Ensure you don’t overshoot RPE—if you jump to RPE 9 or 10, reduce load or volume.

## Summary

APV lets you auto-adjust volume based on real-time feedback. It’s great for building muscle and strength in a flexible manner, ensuring you do enough work when you’re fresh without overdoing it when fatigued.

# 5. Autoregulatory Cluster Sets

## Overview

Cluster sets break a single target set into multiple mini-sets with very short rests to maintain higher quality reps. You stop each mini-set before failure, rest briefly, then continue until you hit your total rep goal.

## Structure

4. **Target Reps**: Decide on total reps (e.g., 12) at a given intensity (~85% 1RM).
5. **Cluster**: Perform a mini-set (e.g., 3–4 reps), rest 10–15 seconds, then do another mini-set.
6. **Repeat**: Continue until all 12 reps are completed.

### Example

- 12 total reps @ 85% 1RM
- Do sets of ~3 reps, rest 15 seconds, repeat until you reach 12 total reps.

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Pick ~85% of your 1RM if aiming for strength, or around RPE 8 for your first mini-set.
- Progress by reducing the number of mini-sets needed to reach total reps or by adding small weight increments once your mini-sets become too easy.

## Rest Intervals

- **Intra-Cluster Rest**: 10–15 seconds.
- **Between Clusters** (if you do multiple cluster “blocks”): 1–2 minutes.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Helps maintain bar speed and rep quality throughout high-intensity work.
- Ideal for intermediate and advanced lifters who want to accumulate volume at a higher intensity.

## Summary

Autoregulatory Cluster Sets allow you to do more high-quality reps before fatigue takes over. This method can boost strength gains while mitigating excessive form breakdown.

# 6. Reps in Reserve (RIR) Progression

## Overview

RIR-based training is a simple autoregulation method. You select a load that leaves a certain number of reps in the tank (e.g., 2 RIR). As you get stronger, you adjust weight or reps accordingly.

## Structure

7. **Target RIR**: Decide how many reps you want left in the tank (e.g., 2 RIR).
8. **Work Sets**: Perform 3–4 sets of a given rep count (e.g., 10 reps) at 2 RIR.
9. **Progress**: When sets feel easier than the set RIR (e.g., 3+ reps left), add weight next session.

### Example

- 4 sets of 10 reps @ 2 RIR.
- If you find you can do 12–13 reps without failure, it means you had more than 2 reps in reserve, so increase the load.

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Start with a moderate weight that you could do for ~12 reps but only do 10.
- Adjust weight each session based on whether you exceed or meet your RIR target.

## Rest Intervals

- Rest 1–3 minutes, depending on lift complexity and personal recovery rate.
- Ensure you’re recovered enough to maintain the desired RIR on each set.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- The method relies on accurate self-assessment of how many reps you have “left.”
- Great for hypertrophy and general strength; it’s simpler than calculating exact percentages.

## Summary

RIR Progression is an easy-to-learn autoregulation method that keeps your effort consistent from session to session. It suits lifters looking to make steady gains without overtraining.

# 7. Wave Loading with Autoregulation

## Overview

Wave Loading alternates sets of varying reps and intensities in “waves.” You move from a higher rep set (lower intensity) to a lower rep set (higher intensity), then repeat. Autoregulation is applied by adjusting load based on your perceived exertion or performance each wave.

## Structure

10. **Wave 1**: 6 reps @ RPE 7, 4 reps @ RPE 8, 2 reps @ RPE 9.
11. **Wave 2**: Slightly increase weight on each set and repeat (6 reps @ RPE 7, 4 @ RPE 8, 2 @ RPE 9).

### Example

- **Wave 1**: 6 reps @ RPE 7 → 4 reps @ RPE 8 → 2 reps @ RPE 9
- **Wave 2**: Add 2.5–5 lb for each step and repeat the 6-4-2 structure.

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Start Wave 1 with a load that matches the RPE you expect (e.g., if your 6-rep set is usually ~75–80% 1RM, use that as a guide).
- Increase load in Wave 2 if the RPE felt lower than targeted.

## Rest Intervals

- Rest 2–3 minutes between sets, or until you’re ready to maintain proper form for the next intensity jump.
- If waves contain heavy singles or doubles, consider 3–4 minutes rest.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Great for intermediate or advanced lifters who can handle changing rep targets in one session.
- Monitor overall fatigue. If your RPE spikes too high, reduce wave intensity.

## Summary

Autoregulatory Wave Loading keeps training interesting and challenges different rep ranges. By adjusting load based on RPE, you ensure each wave hits the right intensity without overreaching.

# 8. Double Progression with RPE Caps

## Overview

Double Progression involves increasing the number of reps within a certain range before adding weight, ensuring consistent progress in both reps and load. Using an RPE cap adds autoregulation, preventing overexertion.

## Structure

12. **Rep Range**: Pick a range (e.g., 8–12 reps).
13. **RPE Cap**: Each set should not exceed RPE 8.
14. **Progress**: When you can complete all sets at the top of the range (e.g., 12 reps) without exceeding RPE 8, you add weight next session.

### Example

- 3–4 sets of 8–12 reps @ RPE 8.
- Once you hit 12 reps on every set comfortably, add 2.5–5 lb next time.

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Begin with a weight you can do for at least 8 reps at RPE 8 or lower.
- Add weight only after reaching the top end of the range for each set without exceeding RPE 8.

## Rest Intervals

- 2–3 minutes between sets to allow sufficient recovery.
- If form degrades or RPE spikes, extend rest as needed.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Perfect for balanced strength and hypertrophy gains.
- Easy to track progression: you either do more reps (same weight) or add weight.

## Summary

Double Progression with RPE Caps offers a structured but flexible progression model. Novices benefit from a clear goal (reaching the top rep range), while advanced lifters can autoregulate intensity with the RPE cap.

## Source Reference

Widely discussed in strength forums like Reddit’s r/weightroom.

# 9. Max Effort with Repetition Backoff (Westside Inspired)

## Overview

This approach emphasizes pushing near your 1RM (max effort) on a key lift, then dropping the load for higher-rep sets. It’s drawn from the Westside Barbell method, typically used by powerlifters.

## Structure

15. **Max Effort**: Work up to 1–2 reps at 90–95% of your 1RM.
16. **Backoff Sets**: Perform 3 sets of 5 reps at ~70% of your top set weight.

### Example

- **Max Effort**: 1–2 reps at 90–95% 1RM
- **Backoff**: 3 sets of 5 reps at 70% of your top set

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Warm up properly, increasing weight in small jumps until you reach near-max load for 1–2 reps.
- If the top set feels too easy (sub-90% effort), add weight next week. Otherwise, maintain or slightly increase.

## Rest Intervals

- For the max effort lift, rest 3–5 minutes to ensure full focus and power.
- For backoff sets, 2–3 minutes rest is typically enough.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Rotate main movements every few weeks (e.g., switch back squat to box squat) to avoid plateaus and overuse.
- Best for intermediate to advanced lifters looking to boost max strength.

## Summary

Max Effort with Repetition Backoff blends heavy, near-limit lifts for strength with moderate-volume backoff sets for extra workload. It’s a classic Westside approach for powerlifting success.

## Source Reference

Inspired by Louie Simmons’ Westside Barbell max effort method.

# 10. Fatigue-Stop Sets (AMRAP with RPE Cap)

## Overview

This method has you do a prescribed number of sets and reps at a moderate load, then on the final set, perform as many reps as possible (AMRAP). However, you stop once you reach a certain RPE (e.g., 9) to avoid excessive fatigue.

## Structure

17. **Main Work**: 3–4 sets of a given rep count (e.g., 8 reps) at ~70% 1RM.
18. **Final Set (AMRAP)**: Do as many reps as you can, stopping at RPE 9 or earlier if form breaks down.

### Example

- 4 sets of 8 @ 70% 1RM
- Final set: AMRAP until RPE 9 (don’t go to failure)

## Load Selection Guidelines

- Choose ~70% 1RM as a starting point for 8 reps.
- If you surpass the target reps by a clear margin on the final set (without hitting RPE 9), increase weight next session.

## Rest Intervals

- Rest 2–3 minutes between sets.
- For the AMRAP set, ensure you feel ready to push near your limit, but not to absolute failure.

## Execution / Key Considerations

- Great for tracking progress: if your AMRAP hits more than the expected rep range, you know to increase weight.
- Helps avoid overshooting your capacity while still gauging strength improvements.

## Summary

Fatigue-Stop Sets offer a controlled way to push near your limits without total burnout. You get enough volume plus a performance test on the last set—useful for beginners and advanced athletes alike.
