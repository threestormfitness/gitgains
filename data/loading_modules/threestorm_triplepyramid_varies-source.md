# PT Pyramid Loading Modules

## PT Pyramid (Classic Version)

### Overview
The PT Pyramid is a no-rest, full-body workout designed to build endurance and muscle stamina. It integrates a warm-up, max effort phase, and cool-down into a single session, making it an efficient conditioning tool. This workout is ideal for improving PT scores and overall functional fitness.

### Structure
Each "step" in the pyramid represents a set, with reps increasing as you ascend and decreasing as you descend. The classic structure includes:

**Ascending the Pyramid:**
1. Set 1: 1 Pullup / 2 Pushups / 3 Situps
2. Set 2: 2 Pullups / 4 Pushups / 6 Situps
3. Set 3: 3 Pullups / 6 Pushups / 9 Situps
4. Set 4: 4 Pullups / 8 Pushups / 12 Situps
5. Set 5: 5 Pullups / 10 Pushups / 15 Situps
6. Set 6: 6 Pullups / 12 Pushups / 18 Situps
7. Set 7: 7 Pullups / 14 Pushups / 21 Situps
8. Set 8: 8 Pullups / 16 Pushups / 24 Situps
9. Set 9: 9 Pullups / 18 Pushups / 27 Situps
10. Set 10: 10 Pullups / 20 Pushups / 30 Situps

**Descending the Pyramid:**
1. Set 9: 9 Pullups / 18 Pushups / 27 Situps
2. Set 8: 8 Pullups / 16 Pushups / 24 Situps
3. Set 7: 7 Pullups / 14 Pushups / 21 Situps
4. Set 6: 6 Pullups / 12 Pushups / 18 Situps
5. Set 5: 5 Pullups / 10 Pushups / 15 Situps
6. Set 4: 4 Pullups / 8 Pushups / 12 Situps
7. Set 3: 3 Pullups / 6 Pushups / 9 Situps
8. Set 2: 2 Pullups / 4 Pushups / 6 Situps
9. Set 1: 1 Pullup / 2 Pushups / 3 Situps

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Choose exercises based on your current fitness level. Adjust multipliers for difficulty:
  - Pullups/Rows: x1
  - Pushups/Dips: x2
  - Situps/Crunches: x3
- Avoid overloading challenging exercises (e.g., don't use x3 for pullups if you can only do 5 reps).
- Aim to complete 6 steps up and down initially, progressing by adding steps as you improve.

### Rest Intervals
- No formal rest periods; rest while transitioning between exercises.
- At the pyramid's peak (step 10), rest for 1 minute before descending.
- Adjust rest as needed based on fatigue and fitness level.

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Best for building endurance and muscle stamina.
- Incorporate 1-2 times per week alongside other strength workouts.
- Modify exercises (e.g., TRX pullups, kettlebell swings) for variety or to adjust difficulty.
- Avoid mixing core-centric exercises with heavy spinal loads to prevent bracing issues.
- If progress stalls, reduce intensity, change exercises, or decrease volume.

### Summary
The PT Pyramid is a versatile, endurance-focused workout that scales with your fitness level. Its no-rest structure challenges muscular stamina and cardiovascular conditioning, making it a valuable tool for improving PT scores and general fitness.

## PT Pyramid (Custom Adaptations)

### Overview
This version of the PT Pyramid allows for customized exercise selection while maintaining the core structure of the pyramid. It is ideal for those looking to tailor the workout to specific fitness goals or preferences, using calisthenics, weights, or mixed modalities.

### Structure
Follow the same pyramid structure (ascending and descending), but select exercises that suit your goals:

**Example Adaptation:**
1. Ring Pullups x1
2. Ring Dips x1
3. Kettlebell Swings x3

**Multipliers:**
- Exercise 1: x1 (e.g., Pullups, Rows)
- Exercise 2: x2 (e.g., Pushups, Dips)
- Exercise 3: x3 (e.g., Situps, Kettlebell Swings)

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Adjust multipliers based on exercise difficulty and personal capacity.
- Choose exercises that balance pushing, pulling, and core engagement.
- Start with a pyramid you can complete for 6 steps up and down, progressing over time.

### Rest Intervals
- Minimal rest; transition between exercises without pausing.
- Rest 1 minute at the pyramid's peak before descending.

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Customize based on available equipment (TRX, kettlebells, rings).
- Avoid combining spine-loaded and core-centric exercises to maintain proper bracing.
- Monitor fatigue levels and adjust intensity or exercise selection if progress stalls.

### Summary
The Custom PT Pyramid offers flexibility to adapt the classic structure to your specific training needs. Whether using bodyweight, free weights, or a mix of modalities, this approach enhances endurance, strength, and muscular stamina.

## PT Pyramid with Added Exercises

### Overview
This variation integrates additional exercises into the pyramid structure, enhancing muscle engagement and variety. It's designed for those seeking a more comprehensive workout targeting multiple muscle groups.

### Structure
Follow the classic pyramid structure, adding exercises such as dips or sprints:

**Example Additions:**
1. Dips: Match the number of dips to pushups (e.g., x2 multiplier).
2. 100m Sprints: Include sprints between pyramid steps for added cardio.

### Load Selection Guidelines
- Match dip reps to pushup counts for balanced upper body work.
- Use sprints to boost cardiovascular intensity but monitor fatigue.
- Adjust intensity and volume based on recovery and performance.

### Rest Intervals
- Minimal rest; rest between exercises only as needed.
- Take longer rests if incorporating high-intensity cardio like sprints.

### Execution / Key Considerations
- Adding dips increases tricep and shoulder engagement.
- Sprints significantly raise cardio demands; ensure proper hydration and nutrition.
- Use caution with added volume to prevent overtraining.

### Summary
Integrating additional exercises like dips or sprints into the PT Pyramid elevates the workout's challenge, targeting more muscle groups and enhancing cardiovascular fitness. This variation suits advanced trainees looking to diversify their routine.

## PT Pyramid Time Calculation

### Overview
To estimate the total workout time for the PT Pyramid, use the following calculation method, factoring in rep speed and rest intervals.

### Structure
- **Rep Speed:** 2 seconds per rep.
- **Transition Rest:** 15 seconds between exercises.
- **Peak Rest:** 1 minute rest at the pyramid's peak.

### Time Calculation Formula
1. Calculate total reps per exercise category (1x, 2x, 3x multipliers).
2. Multiply total reps by 2 seconds per rep.
3. Add 15 seconds per exercise transition.
4. Include 1-minute rest at the peak.

### Example Calculation (6-10 steps):
- **1x Exercises:** 36-100 reps → 72-200 seconds
- **2x Exercises:** 72-200 reps → 144-400 seconds
- **3x Exercises:** 108-300 reps → 216-600 seconds

**Total Time (without rest):** Sum of rep times + transition times.
**Total Time (with rest):** Add peak rest and adjust for additional breaks as needed.

### Summary
Accurately calculating PT Pyramid workout times helps with planning and pacing, ensuring efficient sessions that meet your training goals. Adjust rest and speed based on your fitness level and workout variation.
