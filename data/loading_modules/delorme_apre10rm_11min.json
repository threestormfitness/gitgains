  "overview_and_execution": "Perform four sets. Sets 1-2 are lighter (50% and 75% of your estimated 10RM). Set 3 is an AMRAP at your 10RM. Based on reps completed in Set 3, adjust the weight for the next session. Set 4 uses the newly adjusted load to finish the session. Rest 1 minute between early sets, then 2-5 minutes before heavier sets.",
  "example_application": "If your estimated 10RM for squats is 200 lb, do Set 1: 12 reps at ~100 lb, Set 2: 10 reps at ~150 lb, Set 3: AMRAP at 200 lb. If you get 12 reps, next time add 5-10 lb for the 10RM set. Then Set 4 uses that adjusted weight.",
  "important_notes": "Choose an accurate 10RM. Avoid grinding reps; adjust weight up or down based on performance in Set 3. Rest more before heavier sets. This method reduces the need for scheduled deloads.",
  "volume_metrics": "4 working sets total per exercise, typically 10-12 reps on early sets plus an AMRAP and a final heavy set"
