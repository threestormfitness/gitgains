### Overview and Execution

The 5/3/1 program is a four-week cycle designed to build strength progressively:

- **Week 1**: 65% x 5, 75% x 5, 85% x 5+  
- **Week 2**: 70% x 3, 80% x 3, 90% x 3+  
- **Week 3**: 75% x 5, 85% x 3, 95% x 1+  
- **Week 4 (Deload)**: 40-60% x 5 for all sets

Percentages are based on 90% of your true 1RM (the “training max”). The final “+ set” in Weeks 1–3 is performed for as many clean, solid reps as possible—stop when your form begins to break. Rest 3–5 minutes between heavier sets and 1–2 minutes for lighter/deload sets. At the end of Week 4, increase your training max by 5 lbs for upper-body lifts (bench, overhead press) and 10 lbs for lower-body lifts (squat, deadlift). Then begin the next four-week cycle.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

Although plateaus aren’t explicitly detailed in this module, the program emphasizes **accurate training maxes** and **small weight jumps** after each cycle. If you stall (i.e., fail to meet rep goals for multiple sessions), consider:
- Resetting or lowering your training max by ~10%.
- Ensuring adequate recovery and nutrition.
- Checking form, technique, and accessory work.

### Example Application

Using an intermediate ~185 lbs male lifter with a 300 lbs squat 1RM:

1. **Training Max**: 90% of 300 = 270 lbs.  
2. **Week 1 (5s)**:  
   - 65% x 5 = 175 lbs  
   - 75% x 5 = 205 lbs  
   - 85% x 5+ = 230 lbs (AMRAP)  
3. **Week 2 (3s)**:  
   - 70% x 3 = 190 lbs  
   - 80% x 3 = 215 lbs  
   - 90% x 3+ = 245 lbs (AMRAP)  
4. **Week 3 (5/3/1)**:  
   - 75% x 5 = 205 lbs  
   - 85% x 3 = 230 lbs  
   - 95% x 1+ = 255 lbs (AMRAP)  
5. **Week 4 (Deload)**:  
   - 40–60% x 5 each set, e.g., 120–160 lbs  

After Week 4, increase squat training max by 10 lbs (to 280 lbs) and repeat.

### Important Notes

- **Start with 90% of your 1RM** to avoid stalling too soon.  
- **Perform the final set** each week for maximum quality reps without sacrificing technique.  
- **Add 5 lbs** to upper-body lifts (bench, overhead press) and **10 lbs** to lower-body lifts (squat, deadlift) after each cycle.  
- **Don’t skip the deload**: it’s crucial for recovery and consistent progress over time.

### Volume Metrics

In a typical week (excluding warm-ups and assistance work):  
- **Week 1**: 3 working sets of (5,5,5+)  
- **Week 2**: 3 working sets of (3,3,3+)  
- **Week 3**: 3 working sets of (5,3,1+)  
- **Week 4**: 3 working sets of 5 (deload)  

The plus sets often increase the total rep count depending on individual performance.

### Summary

Wendler’s 5/3/1 program is a tried-and-true method for steady strength gains. Its moderate starting point (90% of 1RM) and small incremental weight increases help lifters avoid plateaus while still pushing for rep records in the final “+ set.” The built-in deload promotes adequate recovery and longevity. This module suits lifters from late-beginner to advanced who want a straightforward framework that balances progression, stability, and long-term training success.
