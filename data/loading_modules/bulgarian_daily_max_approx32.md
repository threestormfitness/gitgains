## Overview and Execution

Daily Max Training mimics aspects of the Bulgarian system, focusing on near-maximal lifts daily or multiple times per week. You ramp up to a heavy single (not necessarily a true 1RM) at RPE 9, then drop down for a few backoff sets at 85–90%.

- **Frequency** can be daily, but that requires advanced recovery strategies.
- **Progression**: If the single feels like RPE 8 or easier, add weight. Otherwise, maintain until it becomes more comfortable.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- **Reduce Frequency**: If you’re training daily and stall, try 3–4 times per week.
- **Light/Speed Sessions**: Insert lighter days focusing on speed to manage overall fatigue.
- **Deload**: If you continually fail to hit your daily max single at a reasonable RPE, drop intensity for a few sessions.

## Example Application

For an intermediate/advanced 185 lb trainee with a ~300 lb bench press 1RM:

- **Session 1**: Ramp to a single at 265 lb (RPE 9). Then 2 sets of 2 at ~225 lb.
- **Session 2**: If 265 lb feels like RPE 8, go for 270 lb.
- **Session 3**: If it’s still RPE 9, stay with 270 lb until it feels easier. Then increase.
- **Next weeks**: Attempt daily or near-daily, adjusting load by feel. If too taxing, add a lighter speed day.

## Important Notes

- Extremely demanding for CNS and joints if done too frequently.
- Best for advanced lifters who can monitor recovery and technique vigilantly. Beginners may overtrain quickly.

## Volume Metrics

Typically ~4–8 total sets per session, focusing on singles or low reps. Volume is lower to compensate for higher intensity and frequency.

## Summary

Daily Max Training (Bulgarian Adaptation) emphasizes frequent heavy singles to build comfort and skill with maximal loads. While effective for advanced lifters, it requires careful fatigue management and is not recommended for beginners lacking robust recovery capacity.
