  "overview_and_execution": "Across four weeks: Week 1 (5s), Week 2 (3s), Week 3 (5/3/1), then Week 4 deload. Each main session has three sets based on 90% of your true 1RM. The final set each week is a ‘+ set’—push for as many quality reps as possible. After the deload, increase your training max by 5 lbs for upper-body lifts and 10 lbs for lower-body lifts, then repeat.",
  "example_application": "If your squat 1RM is 300 lbs, use 270 as your training max (90%). Week 1: 65% x 5 (175 lbs), 75% x 5 (205 lbs), 85% x 5+ (230 lbs). Week 2: 70% x 3 (190 lbs), 80% x 3 (215 lbs), 90% x 3+ (245 lbs). Week 3: 75% x 5 (205 lbs), 85% x 3 (230 lbs), 95% x 1+ (255 lbs). Week 4 (deload): 40-60% x 5 each set.",
  "important_notes": "Use 90% of your 1RM for training max. Always perform the final set for maximum reps without breaking form. After each 4-week cycle, add 5 lbs to upper-body lifts and 10 lbs to squats/deadlifts. Don’t skip the deload for proper recovery.",
  "volume_metrics": "Typically 3 working sets weekly (5,3,1 rep targets), plus a deload (3 sets of 5). The ‘+’ sets increase total reps depending on performance."
