## Overview and Execution

The 5-4-3-2-1 Wave for Strength module involves performing a single wave of five sets. Starting at approximately 80% of your one-rep max (1RM) for five reps, you increase the load with each subsequent set as follows: 4 reps at 85%, 3 reps at 90%, 2 reps at 92%, and finally, 1 rep at about 95% of your 1RM. This wave pattern can be repeated for those with advanced experience, adding slight weight increments per set. This module is primarily suited for intermediate lifters focusing on heavy compound lifts. Each session's duration, composed of five sets, requires approximately 12 minutes, assuming 2 to 3 minutes of rest between sets.

## Plateau or Stalling Strategies

If you encounter a plateau or miss reps, consider implementing a deload week. Gradually reduce intensity to allow recovery and adaptation before resuming the wave cycle.

## Example Application

**Example with Squat:**

- 5 reps × 225 lbs
- 4 reps × 245 lbs
- 3 reps × 265 lbs
- 2 reps × 280 lbs
- 1 rep × 295 lbs

If performing a second wave, add approximately 5 lbs to each set if the first wave was successful.

## Important Notes

- This module is effective for intermediate lifters seeking a structured, heavy approach.
- Ensure rest periods are a minimum of 2-3 minutes to maintain optimal strength across sets.
- Training to failure is suggested only at the final single rep.

## Volume Metrics

For each wave: 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 total reps.

## Summary

The 5-4-3-2-1 Wave for Strength module is designed for intermediate lifters aiming to increase strength via heavy compound movements. It's a structured wave progression method effective over a 4-6 week cycle. This module allows for autoregulation and can be adjusted with a second wave for advanced individuals. Proper rest and adherence to intensity percentages are crucial for optimal results.
