  "overview_and_execution": "Perform your main lift first (e.g., squat, bench, deadlift) at your chosen rep scheme, then do 5 sets of 10 reps at about 50-60% of your 1RM. Gradually increase weight or add reps over time to progress.",
  "example_application": "Week 1: Bench Press 3x5, then 5x10 at 50% 1RM. Week 2: Add 5% more load for the 5x10 sets or move to 5x12 while keeping 50%. Continue increasing weight or reps in small increments each week.",
  "important_notes": "Track recovery carefully. If soreness or fatigue is excessive, reduce intensity or volume. Consistency in hitting the 5x10 sets after the main lift is key to progress.",
  "volume_metrics": "Typically 3 sets of the main lift (1-5 reps each) plus 5 sets of 10 reps, totaling ~8 sets and ~65+ reps per session."
