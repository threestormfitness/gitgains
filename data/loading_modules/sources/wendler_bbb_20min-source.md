# Boring But Big (BBB)

## Overview
Boring But Big (BBB) is a high-volume strength training template designed to enhance both hypertrophy and strength. It is often integrated into 5/3/1 programming but can also be used as an independent volume block. The core principle is performing **5 sets of 10 repetitions** of a primary lift after completing the main strength work.

## Structure
1. **Main Lift:** Perform the primary strength movement (e.g., squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead press) following your chosen set and rep scheme.
2. **Supplemental Volume Work:** Immediately after the main lift, execute **5 sets of 10 reps** of the same exercise or a variation, typically at **50-60% of 1RM**.

### Example Implementation:
- **Day 1:**
  - **Main Lift:** Bench Press – 3x5
  - **Supplemental Volume:** Bench Press – 5x10 @ 50% of 1RM

- **Day 2:**
  - **Main Lift:** Squat – 3x5
  - **Supplemental Volume:** Squat – 5x10 @ 50% of 1RM

## Load Selection Guidelines
- **Starting Point:** Begin with **50% of your 1RM** for the 5x10 work.
- **Progression Options:**
  1. **Incremental Weight Increase**:
     - Increase the weight gradually over multiple weeks.
     - Example:
       - **Weeks 1-2:** 50% of 1RM
       - **Weeks 3-4:** 55% of 1RM
       - **Weeks 5-6:** 60% of 1RM
 

## Rest Intervals
- **Between Main Lift Sets:** 2-4 minutes, depending on intensity.
- **Between Supplemental Sets:** 60-90 seconds (shorter for hypertrophy focus, longer if needed for recovery).

## Execution / Key Considerations
- **Exercise Variation:** If needed, replace the supplemental work with a variation of the main lift (e.g., Romanian deadlifts after conventional deadlifts).
- **Fatigue Management:** The high volume can be demanding. Reduce weight or adjust frequency if recovery becomes an issue.
- **Consistency Matters:** Success with BBB requires adherence to progressive overload and proper form to minimize injury risk.

## Summary
Boring But Big is an effective method for building muscle and reinforcing movement patterns with additional volume. It works well as a standalone volume block or within larger strength programs. Proper load selection, structured progression, and attention to recovery ensure long-term success.
