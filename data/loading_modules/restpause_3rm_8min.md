### Overview and Execution

Use a weight close to your **3RM** (about 90% of 1RM). Perform 3 reps, rack the bar, rest for ~30 seconds, then do mini-sets of 2 reps with 30 seconds rest until you can no longer complete 2 reps. After that, finish with singles (1 rep) until failure, still resting ~30 seconds between reps. Once you reach a total of about 10 reps, increase the load by 2.5–5 lbs in the next session.

### Plateau or Stalling Strategies

- If you repeatedly fail to reach your rep target, drop the load by ~10% and rebuild.
- You could also extend the rest from 30 seconds to 45 seconds for a session or two.

### Example Application

**For an intermediate 185 lb male** with a ~300 lb 1RM bench press, the 3RM might be around 270 lbs.

- Perform 3 reps at 270 lbs, rest 30s, then sets of 2 reps until you can’t get 2. After that, do singles.
- If you total ~10 reps (e.g., 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1), next session try 275 lbs.
- If you fail earlier than expected, reduce to ~260 lbs next time and build back up.

### Important Notes

- Strict form is crucial—rest-pause with near-max loads can quickly lead to sloppy technique if not monitored.
- Keep volume under control to avoid excessive fatigue.

### Volume Metrics

- **Varies**, depending on how many mini-sets you achieve. Typically ranges between 6–12 total reps.

### Summary

This rest-pause method intensifies your 3RM training by letting you squeeze extra reps from heavy loads. It’s best suited for intermediate-to-advanced lifters needing a novel stimulus to break strength plateaus on key lifts.
